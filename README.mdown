# Django-Hines

The code for the personal website of Phil Gyford.

This is very much a work in progress and is probably no use to anyone yet. 
Including me.

This is not supposed to create a generic site that will be useful to 
everyone. It's a personal project to satisfy specific requirements. So, 
while I'm happy to hear ideas, at this stage, they'll only ever be 
implemented if they're useful to me. But you never know.

##Â Installation

As I said, this isn't at a stage it's useful to anyone, and I haven't 
tried setting it up from scratch yet, but still, extremely briefly...

1. I've been using [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv), 
   [virtualenvwrapper](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/) 
   and [pip](http://pip.openplans.org/). The pip requirements file is at 
   django-hines/requirements.txt.

2. Copy django-hines/hines/settings.py.template to 
   django-hines/hines/settings.py and add your own local settings.

3. You'll need to set up a Site in the Django Admin, and also an 
   Aggregator, related to the Site you just created.
