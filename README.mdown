# Django-Hines

The code for the personal website of Phil Gyford.

This is very much a work in progress and is probably no use to anyone yet. Including me.

## Apps (so far)

* Weblog
    * Multiple blogs
    * Uses comments
    * Daily/monthly archives
    * RSS feeds
* Aggregator
    * Aggregates posts from the various weblogs

## Major future tasks

* Add tagging and categories to weblog
* Fetch and display Last.fm listening
* Fetch and display Twitter statuses
* Fetch and display Flickr photos
* Put located tweets and photos on maps
* Records of books and magazines read
* Records of films (and gigs etc?) attended
* Nice templates

##Â Installation

As I said, this isn't at a stage it's useful to anyone, and I haven't tried setting it up from scratch yet, but still, extremely briefly...

* I've been using [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv), [virtualenvwrapper](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/) and [pip](http://pip.openplans.org/). The pip requirements file is at django-hines/requirements.txt.
* Copy django-hines/hines/settings.py.template to django-hines/hines/settings.py and add your own local settings.
