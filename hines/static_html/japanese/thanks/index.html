        <li>
          I've only recently started studying japanese and I just wanted to
          thank you for your website. I really appreciate the minimalist design,
          it's exactly what I was looking for. Through your webpage I will
          certainly be able to learn to recognize the Kana symbols much quicker.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just wanted to give you a quick thank you for your Japanese Katakana
          and Hiragana quiz. It has helped me with my reading skills
          tremendously, I found myself able to read all of the characters so
          much quicker! Went from finishing the quiz in 25 minutes to finishing
          in 8 minutes over the course of two days. Super helpful!
        </li>
        <li>
          Just to say I'm finding your quiz very useful for fixing the
          characters into my head, an excellent supplementary exercise to
          support learning the glyphs. Thank you!
        </li>
        <li>
          I just found out about the site and it really helps me remember
          hiragana and katakana more quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's been more than 30 years that I learned a bit of Japanese; my
          hiragana were rusty and I'd forgotten more than half the katakana;
          your quiz helped me refresh my memory.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="2020">2020</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I have used a variety of techniques to test myself on Hiragana and
          Katakana, and I would just like to thank you for your quiz, it is
          awesome and includes all of the variants and combinations that other
          similar sites don&#39;t offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          I really like your Hiragana and Katakana Quiz. It helped me a lot
          learning the alphabets and i do it every day, so thanks for that.
        </li>
        <li>
          I just wanted to say thank you for the quizzes that you made about
          Japanese alphabets on your website. It does help me a lot on my study.

        <li>
          I just wanted to let you know your hiragana/katakana quiz is just
          fantastic. I&#39;ve been looking for a simple, straightforward quiz
          that&#39;s not multiple choice for weeks to keep my reading sharp
          between quarters and yours is better than some I&#39;ve paid for.

      <h2 id="2014">2014</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>
          Thank you for your website, I’ve found it extremely useful to practice
          my hiragana and katakana, it's user friendly and very easy to use (and
          discreet to pratice at work).
        </li>
        <li>
          I&#39;d like to say a very big thank you for the online kana practice
          tool on your website. I have introduced it to many of my friends who
          are also beginner Japanese language students, and they have all found
          it very useful.
        </li>
        <li>
          I just wanted to say thanks for making the awesome webpage
          ‘www.gyford.com/japanese’. I don’t know how long ago you made it, but
          when I found it 2 days ago, my proficiency in recognizing Hiragana and
          katakana has increased 10 fold. I like the simplicity and instant
          feedback it provides.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="2012">2012</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Thank you for producing the hiragana/katakana tester, it&#39;s very
          useful!
        </li>
        <li>
          I just spent the last hour using your Hiragana/Katakana practice site,
          I found it real useful as I&#39;m currently learning Japanese.
        </li>
        <li>
          I would like to thank-you for hosting your Hiragana and Katakana
          practice application on your site. It&#39;s been very useful in
          helping me learn them. Out of all the other ways of learning I found
          online, yours was the best by far.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="2011">2011</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I just thought I&#39;d send you an email thanking you for creating the
          Hiragana and Katakana practice. I&#39;ve been using it for a few hours
          now and it is really fun and helpful.
        </li>
        <li>
          i just wanna thank you for your little japanese practice exercise.
          It&#39;s helped me a lot. thank you.

      </ul>

      <h2 id="2010">2010</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I&#39;ve used our hiragana and katakana practice program on your
          website, and even though it is so simple, it works really well. I
          learned Hiragana in a weekend using it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I must say that not only it helps me to remember EVERY single
          possibility with both alphabets, it also gives me a score which help
          me to persevere until i get a perfect one, which i just had only a few
          hours after learning the katakanas.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="2009">2009</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I just had to tell you, thank you for the Japanese Writing practise.
          It helped me out incredibly, and i will refer it to anyone who needs
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your website is awesome. I really enjoy quizzing myself on the
          different combinations like “pya.” It also helps me know which
          characters I need to work on, gives my brain a challenge, and I can
          read Japanese a lot faster because of it! Thank you for this wonderful
          practice tool.
        </li>
      </ul>
