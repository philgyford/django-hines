      <p><font color="#999999">[Comment: This was knocked up at the last minute, 
        and I didn't like the outline anyway: choose research and scanning sources 
        both for general subjects and specific topics. The pre-set structure is 
        far too, well, structured for how I organise such things. It repeats itself 
        and a lot of what I wrote is nonsense.]</font></p>
      <p>[ <b>Research</b> | <a href="research_scanning_02.html">Scanning</a> 
        ] </p>
      <p><b>Domain:</b> The Internet</p>
      <p><b>Books</b></p>
      <p><i>Burn Rate</i>, Michael Wolff. A description of how Wolff attempted 
        to find funding for his Internet enterprise in the early years of the 
        Web. As vivid a description as one is likely to get of how quickly ideas 
        shift, the attitudes of the industry, and how people have struggled to 
        come to terms with doing business in a completely new form of media.</p>
      <p><i>Neuromancer</i>, William Gibson. Fiction, but essential for an image 
        of a possible future for the Internet. The classic cyberpunk novel, Gibson's 
        descriptions of characters immersing themselves in a shifting world of 
        data colours many people's views of what the Net is and could be.</p>
      <p><i>Snow Crash</i>, Neal Stephenson. Another fictional tale, Stephenson 
        described virtual reality better than anyone. Characters have an alternate 
        existence in the Metaverse where they exist as avatars in a 3D world.</p>
      <p><i>Where Wizards Stay Up Late</i>, Katie Hafner & Matthew Lyon. This 
        book describes the birth of the Internet thirty years ago, and how it 
        all began to come together into the Net we know today. Few people know 
        much of the history beyond a few years ago, but this fills all the gaps.</p>
      <p><b>Journals</b></p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a></i>. A business 
        magazine of the Internet age, it has a strong emphasis on futures material. 
      </p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.wfs.org/fsurv.htm">Future Survey</a></i>. A monthly 
        round-up of books oriented to the future. Each month concentrates on one 
        or more fields.</p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.wfs.org/futurist.htm">The Futurist</a></i>. The 
        magazine of the World Future Society, is rarely as interesting as one 
        hopes, considering the potential.</p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.techreview.com/">MIT Technology Review</a></i>. 
        &quot;MIT's Magazine of Innovation&quot; concentrates on new inventions 
        and the development of ideas. Good for seeing technologies make their 
        way slowly into the mainstream.</p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">Wired</a></i>. The magazine 
        that saw the &quot;digital revolution&quot; coming has lost its edge now 
        that everyone has caught up with it, but still comes up with interesting, 
        in depth articles and names to watch (even if they¹re increasingly involved 
        in setting up revolutionary online brokerages).</p>
      <p><b>Indexes</b></p>

      <p><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>. &quot;News for Nerds. Stuff 
        that Matters.&quot; A hugely popular site oriented towards open source 
        software, cryptography, and anything else technology-related. A dozen 
        or so items appear every day, submitted by its faithful readership. Every 
        item has a discussion board attached, and thankfully customisation means 
        you can filter out everything but the comments rated as worthwhile by 
        readers.</p>
      <p>Weblogs. A whole slew of weblogs (of which Scripting News and Slashdot 
        could also be examples), sites generally updated at least once a day with 
        interesting links. <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/">www.robotwisdom.com</a> 
        was one of the first, and <a href="http://www.eatonweb.com/portal/">www.eatonweb.com/portal/</a> 
        lists more than you will ever need.</p>
      <p><b>Web authorities/destinations</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.ntk.net/">Need to Know</a>. &quot;*The* weekly high-tech 
        sarcastic update for the UK.&quot; Invaluable weekly newsletter and website 
        oriented towards British geeks. News stories, URLs, events, memes, reviews. 
        And it's funny, too.</p>
      <p><a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/">Risks Digest</a>. Full of reports 
        on the downside of technology, it's a &quot;forum on the risks to the 
        public in computers and related systems.&quot; News on bugs, failures, 
        hacks, virii and other such delights.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.tbtf.com/">Tasty Bits from the Technology Front. 
        </a>An irregular email from Keith Dawson, full of Net-oriented news and 
        insightful analysis. He recently gave in to the pressures of timeliness 
        and started a <a href="http://www.tbtf.com/blog/">weblog</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.well.com/">The Well</a>. An old online community 
        based in San Francisco. Full of interesting discussions, pointless arguments, 
        utter nonsense and all the usual Net community phenomena.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired News</a>. Now a different company 
        than its hard-copy relative, this is a regularly updated news site oriented 
        towards all things technology.</p>
      <p><b>Experts</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.carlsteadman.com/">Carl Steadman</a>. Carl's your 
        pal. Carl's everyone's pal. Started <a href="http://www.suck.com/">www.suck.com</a> 
        with Joey Anuff while working at <i>Wired</i>, and now writes a column 
        for <i>The Industry Standard</i>. You can buy cookies with his face on.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>. Always has something 
        interesting to say about everything to do with the Internet, culture, 
        media, you name it.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/people/nicholas/">Nicholas Negroponte</a>. 
        Helped fund Wired which entitled him to a back page column every month 
        in which to talk nonsense about tomorrow's technology. Has plenty of interesting 
        ideas but also seems to believe developing countries need satellite networks 
        and paper-thin computers rather than food, water or debt relief.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.photo.net/philg/">Philip Greenspun</a>. Purveyor 
        of much-needed sense about building websites and how to make things happen 
        on the Net.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/">Robert Cringely</a>. Writes a 
        weekly column for PBS which I never get round to reading, but his books 
        and TV shows were fun and informative.</p>
      <p><b>Searching</b></p>
      <p><font color="#999999">[The task was to perform a search which returned 
        a few dozen relevant links.]</font> I don't believe it matters whether 
        your search turns up hundreds of results, as long as the results listed 
        first are relevant. For example, if I'm looking for information about 
        developing content for mobile phones I'll type &quot;wap wml developing&quot; 
        into Google and get back 180 pages, but the first few pages will contain 
        more than enough worthwhile links. On the other hand, entering &quot;+wap 
        +wml +developing&quot; into AltaVista returns only 98 pages, but those 
        listed first aren't all as useful as those returned by Google.</p>
