      <p>This paper looks at whether the Internet will cause cultures around the 
        world to become increasingly similar, or instead encourage greater diversity. 
        I conducted five telephone interviews on these and other effects over 
        the next ten years. The interviewees mostly work within the UK new media 
        industry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>E-business Manager for a large multinational 
        <li>Editor of a weekly Internet news e-zine 
        <li>Business Development Manager of a large ISP 
        <li>Vice President at a broadband ISP 
        <li>Professor in New Media 
      </ul>
      <p>Each was sent a copy of the questions in advance of the conversations, 
        which all lasted less than thirty minutes.</p>
      <p>We covered a wide range of topics and most respondents agreed with one 
        overall theme. The question was whether the increase in the Net's popularity 
        will increase the homogeneity of world culture or create more diversity. 
        Both outcomes seem perfectly plausible. Firstly, the spread of Western 
        (usually American) cultures into other societies is already apparent, 
        largely due to the ability of TV, movies, etc. to spread ideas and images 
        quickly. The Net may simply increase the ease of disseminating these ideas 
        more quickly and thoroughly. On the other hand, the Net is different from 
        traditional mass media. It is more easily personalised and allows individuals 
        to publish their own material. This ability gives people more power to 
        control their 'viewing' and, more importantly, to create their own audiences. 
        These differences from the mass broadcast model have the potential to 
        fragment cultures.</p>
      <p>The respondents largely agreed that both trends could become increasingly 
        strong: cultures around the world will become more alike, while the differences 
        within each culture will become more distinct. These two contrasting trends 
        of increasing and decreasing homogeneity almost imply each other at a 
        logical level. As a national culture absorbs influences from others around 
        the world it will encompass more diversity, becoming an amalgam of many 
        fragments drawn from diverse sources. However, as more countries undergo 
        this transformation, absorbing more foreign influences, they will become 
        increasingly alike. Eventually all countries will consist of similar mixtures 
        of international influences, creating a more homogenous world culture 
        than we have today.</p>
      <p>One interviewee uses Europe as a &quot;test case,&quot; stating that 
        on one level it is becoming more like a single country. For example, passports 
        are't necessary for travel and it seems likely that the Euro will become 
        the standard currency. On a continent-wide level Europe is becoming more 
        homogenous, with poorer countries being brought up to similar standards 
        of living through grants and trade. On a national level however the effect 
        of closer neighbours is increasing differences within nations as attributes 
        of foreign cultures are absorbed. This example does not account for the 
        phenomenon of increasing regional identity, such as that of warring factions 
        in former Yugoslavia or more peacefully in the devolution of Scotland. 
        While an increase in a nation or region's diversity does occur, it may 
        meet with resistance as people stand up for their native culture (another 
        example being France's continual stand against the influence of the English 
        language on their own soil). Extrapolating the European example to a global 
        scale, an expansion of regional friction within nations may be the reaction 
        to absorbing foreign cultures.</p>
      <p>Another respondent thinks that while the increasing ease of access to 
        information about other cultures is speeding the homogenisation of the 
        globe, people are associating more with cultures rather than with nations. 
        National identity is becoming less dominant and cultural identity more 
        so, with individuals feeling less connection to the traditional concept 
        of a nation. People don't feel bound by their nation's borders and see 
        themselves as global citizens, an attitude typified by <i>Wallpaper*</i> 
        magazine. One interviewee sees geography becoming irrelevant when it comes 
        to people connecting through common interest while another asserts, &quot;There 
        is and will be a decrease in mass media as a unifying force in a society, 
        but it will unify people within a global audience.&quot; However, he doesn't 
        expect this unifying power of the media to be as powerful as it once was, 
        with the flexibility of the Internet able to create more targeted and 
        individual media experiences.</p>
      <p>Between these two levels of fragmented nations and global homogeneity, 
        language may create another form of association. The arrival of &quot;language 
        networks&quot; whose borders are defined by a shared language was suggested. 
        For example, an English speaker in New Zealand will feel himself part 
        of a network with Britain, Hong Kong, and other English-speaking nations. 
        Trade will create links between networks at an economic level and people 
        will use the official second language of the 21st century, English. The 
        possibility was also raised that English could one day become the first 
        language around the world, depending on whether new generations learn 
        it or not.</p>
      <p>Few of the other subjects share such a rigid definition of language networks. 
        One respondent agreed that these networks will arise on the level of the 
        Internet, although right now tools like AltaVista's <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">Babelfish</a> 
        ease the translation of foreign language websites. Back in the real world 
        though, he acknowledges that however strong such virtual networks are, 
        &quot;France is still going to be closer than Australia.&quot; Countries 
        that have a strong tradition of a second language will have an advantage, 
        being able to access 'foreign' networks, while others, such as China, 
        could still remain culturally isolated in an era of global connections. 
        Another view was that information can easily be personalised and distributed 
        in many languages, creating language-oriented virtual networks.</p>
      <p>From all this an image of a world based on geography becomes increasingly 
        irrelevant. On a personal level, people will associate with those groups 
        which share their interest or culture, groups existing within boundaries 
        defined by language. Traditional national borders become increasingly 
        irrelevant as the rate of information flow amongst cultures rises. There 
        will still be cultural differences among groups, but these groups will 
        be less reliant on geography to define their boundaries.</p>
      <p>There is a plausible alternative however, one which other interviewees 
        may have found more likely. Some people have suggested that while the 
        Internet is currently a varied and eclectic place it is destined to become 
        increasingly more like conventional media, dominated by large multinational 
        companies. It will still be technically possible for people to create 
        their own content but the majority of users will only visit the large 
        corporate sites which is little different from the effect of TV. In fact 
        this consolidation is already underway, with Internet statistics firm 
        Media Metrix stating that 20 percent of time spent on the Web is at the 
        top ten sites.</p>
      <p>The respondents may agree on this issue because they all, to varying 
        degrees, know each other and are drawn from a similar area of a small 
        industry. If, for example, five TV executives had been questioned we may 
        have drawn very different conclusions. It should not, however, be assumed 
        that the interviewees were all of one mind. Questions not directly relevant 
        to this paper's topic were asked and a surprising amount of disagreement 
        was evident.</p>
