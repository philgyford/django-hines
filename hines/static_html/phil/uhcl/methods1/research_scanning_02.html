      <p><font color="#999999">[Comment: This was knocked up at the last minute, 
        and I didn't like the outline anyway: choose research and scanning sources 
        both for general subjects and specific topics. The pre-set structure is 
        far too, well, structured for how I organise such things. It repeats itself 
        and a lot of what I wrote is nonsense.]</font></p>
      <p>[ <a href="research_scanning.html">Research</a> | <b>Scanning</b> ]</p>
      <p><b>Categories, General</b></p>
      <p>There are an infinite number of ways to categorise the world, but I'm 
        not sure of the point in creating yet another means of doing so. I find 
        the STEEP (Sociological, Technological, Economic, Environmental and Political) 
        categories work well for in this field, and creating proprietary methods 
        would only confuse matters.</p>
      <p>Were you to expand this further, Yahoo's categories work well (and have 
        the benefit of testing and familiarity):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arts & Humanities 
        <li>Business & Economy 
        <li>Computers & Internet 
        <li>Education 
        <li>Entertainment 
        <li>Government 
        <li>Health 
        <li>News & Media 
        <li>Recreation & Sports 
        <li>Regional 
        <li>Science 
        <li>Social Science 
        <li>Society & Culture 
      </ul>
      <p>Personally however, I prefer a modification of the categories I developed 
        for my site (<a href="http://www.haddock.org/">www.haddock.org</a>):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Art & Design 
        <li>Business & Economy 
        <li>Computers & Internet 
        <li>Education 
        <li>Media 
        <li>Politics 
        <li>Recreation 
        <li>Science & Technology 
        <li>Society 
      </ul>
      <p><b>Categories, Internet</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Development (html, programming, design, etc.) 
        <li>Economics (ecommerce, companies, IPOs, etc.) 
        <li>Media 
        <li>Networking (back-end hardware and software) 
        <li>Politics & Law 
        <li>Society (people, communities, etc.) 
      </ul>
      <p><b>Sources scanned regularly, General</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News Online</a>. Recently re-designed 
        to make it much less attractive, but a good up-to-the-minute coverage 
        of stories, with extra in-depth reporting, audio and video. Generally 
        excellent science and technology section.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/">EurekaAlert!</a>. Press releases 
        from universities and research institutions. A good source of up-to-date 
        progress and ideas.</p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.flashartmagazine.com/">Flash Art</a></i>. Monthly 
        fine art magazine. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.graphis.com/"><i>Graphis</i></a>. Design magazine, 
        from architecture to photography.</p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.techreview.com/">MIT Technology Review</a></i>. 
        &quot;MIT's Magazine of Innovation&quot; concentrates on new inventions 
        and the development of ideas. Good for seeing technologies make their 
        way slowly into the mainstream.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.moreover.com/">Moreover</a>. A customisable aggregator 
        of news headlines, scanning 1,500 titles in over 170 selectable categories. 
        Set up your own page of headlines, just how you want it.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.newstatesman.co.uk/"><i>New Statesman</i></a>. Left-of-centre 
        weekly British political magazine, although perhaps not as left-of-centre 
        as it might be.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/"><i>New Scientist</i></a>. UK science 
        magazine.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/"><i>News Unlimited</i></a>. 
        The UK <i>Guardian</i> and <i>Observer</i> website. Takes too many clicks 
        to get to some stories, and you have to filter out the large amount of 
        worthless lifestyle articles, as with any newspaper, but it has news stories, 
        like any paper.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.salon.com/">Salon</a>. San Francisco-based vaguely 
        alternative magazine. Not as up to the minute as it once was, but still 
        some good writers and in-depth articles. But if there's a good article 
        you'll probably see it linked to from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Weblogs. A whole slew of weblogs (of which <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting 
        News</a> and <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> could also 
        be examples), sites generally updated at least once a day with interesting 
        links. Some which I scan regularly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/%7Ejacobs/">Genehack</a>
        <li><a href="http://www.chaparraltree.com/honeyguide/">Honeyguide</a>

      </ul>
      <p><b>Sources scanned regularly, Internet</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.allnetdevices.com/">All Net Devices</a>. A daily 
        selection of news stories related to anything which can pick up IP tone. 
        From WAP phones to Internet refrigerators.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.moreover.com/">Moreover</a>. A customisable aggregator 
        of news headlines, scanning 1,500 titles in over 170 selectable categories. 
        Set up your own page of headlines, just how you want it.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.ntk.net/">Need to Know</a>. &quot;*The* weekly high-tech 
        sarcastic update for the UK.&quot; Invaluable weekly newsletter and website 
        oriented towards British geeks. News stories, URLs, events, memes, reviews. 
        And it's funny, too.</p>
      <p><a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/">Risks Digest</a>. Full of reports 
        on the downside of technology, it's a &quot;forum on the risks to the 
        public in computers and related systems.&quot; News on bugs, failures, 
        hacks, virii and other such delights.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. Filter out some 
        of Dave Winer's nonsense and the reports on his company¹s new products 
        and you have a useful, up-to-the-minute log of Net happenings. If something 
        worthwhile happens, it'll turn up here.</p>
      <p><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>. &quot;News for Nerds. Stuff 
        that Matters.&quot; A hugely popular site oriented towards open source 
        software, cryptography, and anything else technology-related. A dozen 
        or so items appear every day, submitted by its faithful readership. Every 
        item has a discussion board attached, and thankfully customisation means 
        you can filter out everything but the comments rated as worthwhile by 
        readers.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.tbtf.com/">Tasty Bits from the Technology Front. 
        </a>An irregular email from Keith Dawson, full of Net-oriented news and 
        insightful analysis. He recently gave in to the pressures of timeliness 
        and started a <a href="http://www.tbtf.com/blog/">weblog</a>.</p>
      <p>Weblogs. See above for links.</p>
      <p><i><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">Wired</a></i>. The magazine 
        that saw the &quot;digital revolution&quot; coming has lost its edge now 
        that everyone has caught up with it, but still comes up with interesting, 
        in depth articles and names to watch (even if they¹re increasingly involved 
        in setting up revolutionary online brokerages).</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired News</a>. Now a different company 
        than its hard-copy relative, this is a regularly updated news site oriented 
        towards all things technology.</p>
