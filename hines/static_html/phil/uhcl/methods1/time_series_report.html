      <p><b>The percentage of women in the US civilian workforce</b><br>
        <a href="http://www.economagic.com/em-cgi/data.exe/BLSLF/LFS1600002">www.economagic.com/em-cgi/data.exe/BLSLF/LFS1600002</a> 
      </p>
      <p>Since 1948 the percentage of women who are at work has increased at a 
        remarkably steady rate, from 30.9% to 57.2% in September 1999. While there 
        are several small peaks and troughs in the progress, we can see from the 
        chart (the 'Data' line) that it's not too far from a straight line. The 
        few irregularities would seem to be due to fluctuations in the labour 
        market as a whole, rather than factors particularly affecting the female 
        workforce; if we compare the data to the percentage of men in the workforce 
        ('Male Data') we can see that the irregularities are echoed there. Incidentally, 
        the percentage of men has decreased at a fairly steady rate over the same 
        period, from 83.8% to 71.6%.</p>
      <p>Taking the average figure for each month, we can see there is a very 
        slight amount of seasonality in the data: On average there have been more 
        women at work in the summer (peaking at 43.8% in September) compared to 
        the winter months (a low of 43.4% in January). This indicates the seasonal 
        nature of many jobs, from agriculture to tourism, also indicated by the 
        slight rise in November and December, the holiday season. While these 
        are only small differences (I expected to find more change), I deseasonalized 
        the data to remove these slight fluctuations: dividing each data point 
        by its corresponding seasonal average and multiplying by 100 creates a 
        deseasonalized index of the data which is used through the following process.</p>
      <p>The deseasonalizing also has the effect of amplifying the data, which 
        lets us see the discontinuities more clearly in the graph. While there 
        are deviations in its steady rise, there appears to be little in the way 
        of short-term error, so there is no reason to smooth the data.</p>
      <p>Next I measured the linear trend. Given that the dataset is from such 
        a long period, during which many factors will have changed, I decided 
        to use only the last few years to determine the trend. Between 1983 and 
        1991 there was a peak in the percentage of women employed, after which 
        the rate of increase has remained steady. Assuming the cause of this 'bubble' 
        has now passed, I used the data from 1991 to 1999 for this first measurement 
        of the trend ('Trend 1' on the graph). I calculated the regression parameters 
        for these years, giving a monthly increase of 0.102 on a line which would 
        cross the y-axis at 69.343. After using these figures to calculate trend 
        values for each month, the deviation of the data from the trend is found 
        by subtracting one from the other.</p>
      <p>I averaged the final three years of the deviation, assuming this would 
        be a suitable length of time to account for any extremely short term errors. 
        I projected the trend ahead through to 2010, and subtracting the average 
        deviation from these figures gives us a projection of the deseasonalized 
        data ('Deseas 1'). Multiplying each of these figures by its seasonal average 
        and dividing by 100 gives us a reseasonalized projection of the original 
        data ('Data' again).</p>
      <p>As might be expected by using eight years of steady increase for the 
        sample data, the extrapolation rises steadily, giving us 64% of women 
        at work by the end of 2010. I wondered whether the result would be different 
        using the entire dataset, rather than relying on only the previous eight 
        years, and calculated the forecast again ('Trend 2,' 'Deseas 2,' 'Data 
        2'). There was very little difference in this compared with the first 
        iteration, indicating how steady the rate of increase has been over fifty 
        years; this version gives us 63.9% of women at work in ten years time.</p>
