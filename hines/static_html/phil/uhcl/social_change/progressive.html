      <p>Progressive theories of social change (such as those of Auguste Comte 
        and Ferdinand Toennies) are almost comforting in their descriptions of 
        the development of civilisation towards ever more advanced states. Progress 
        is seen as inevitable; humans cannot help but move gradually from a traditional 
        society in which families tend their own fields and are in awe of religion, 
        to a rational and capitalist world of cities and technology in which individuals 
        are part of a larger production system. </p>
      <p>This is not to say the ultimate condition is wholly desirable. For example, 
        while Toennies' <i>Gesellschaft</i> is an economically efficient world, 
        it is at the expense of family life. The wisdom of science over religion 
        is enlightened, but it relies on learning which is not available to all. 
        Individuals are free from the restrictions of tradition, but they must 
        abide by the laws of the state. However, with this situation mirroring 
        that of developed countries since the Industrial Revolution, I feel most 
        people would see what is usually the final stage of the progression as 
        both preferable and inevitable. Despite its romantic attractions, few 
        would be willing to give up the benefits of modern life for a return to 
        the Dark Ages, and the development of the western world can easily be 
        seen as a series of logical steps down a path to civilisation. This reliance 
        on our past experience of change is, however, part of the fault with progressive 
        theories for two possible reasons. </p>
      <p>Firstly, no matter how far we cast our net looking for histories of social 
        change around the world, will we really have found all possibilities? 
        Are there no other paths humans could have taken apart from that leading 
        to a generically western world view? This thinking is similar to that 
        of anyone who sees evolution as a path leading inevitably to the existence 
        of humans. Relying on past experience to describe a generic phenomenon 
        does not encourage an expansive point of view. Describing the evolutionary 
        path from single cells to human beings as the only path living creatures 
        could take seems ridiculous given the incomprehensibly vast possibilities. 
        However, there may be characteristics which, if not inevitable, are far 
        more likely to occur than pure chance would suggest. For example, almost 
        all creatures are symmetrical, have two eyes, one brain, a mouth at the 
        front of their body. In a similar manner, perhaps there are general features 
        of the societal evolution which are, if not inevitable, much more likely 
        to occur than chance would suggest. In <i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i>, 
        Daniel C. Dennett points out that science and art differ greatly; if Newton 
        hadn't existed to write his <i>Principia</i>, someone else would have 
        come to the same conclusions about gravity, whereas if Shakespeare had 
        never lived no one else would have written his plays; "the difference 
        is the difference between discovery and creation." If scientific discoveries, 
        major drivers of social change, are virtually inevitable (a case of "when" 
        rather than "if"), perhaps progressive theories <i>are</i> more useful 
        as generic descriptions than their reliance on our past might suggest. 
        This is not to say that the current state of any society is inevitable 
        (just as the evolution of <i>homo sapiens</i> is not a forgone conclusion), 
        but there may indeed be broad aspects, particularly those reliant in some 
        way on technological development, which would have occurred sooner or 
        later.</p>
      <p>However, progressive theories of change cannot escape so easily from 
        the second possible criticism. The reliance on human experience encourages 
        us to think we are at the end of change, that western societies have reached 
        the end of the path in societal progression. Again, this is similar to 
        viewing evolution as leading ultimately to humans, the error being to 
        assume there is no more change after us. Of course, evolution will continue 
        as long as there are living beings, just as societies will continue to 
        change. We haven't reached the path's destination because there is no 
        destination. For this reason, such descriptions of social change are like 
        trying to extrapolate a curve on a graph while only looking at a tiny 
        section of it. We can attempt to describe how we got here, but assuming 
        this is the whole picture will lead us to make incorrect assumptions about 
        the future. </p>
      <p>These theories are certainly not to be wholly discounted, but in their 
        attempt to describe all of society (and all of societies) with a single 
        progression they overstep themselves. It's certainly possible to look 
        at a single culture and describe it in terms that make progressive theories 
        seem logical, but when that is stretched to cover every culture which 
        exists, and that <i>could</i> exist, the idea breaks down. There are certainly 
        elements, such as technology, which depend on the progression of ideas 
        and which we could say have some inevitability to their discovery, but 
        applying this concept to every facet of human culture is making society 
        appear more logical than it really is. </p>
