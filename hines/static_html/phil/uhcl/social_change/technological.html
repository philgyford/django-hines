      <p>The Internet, and the expansion of communication networks which goes 
        along with it, would seem to be the technology affecting the world more 
        than any other at this moment. It is thus worth examining in light of 
        theories of change that suggest technology changes society, rather than 
        <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
      <p>Despite the speed with which the Internet has become part of many people's 
        daily lives, it will be some time before we can its most profound effects 
        are noticeable. William F. Ogburn, describes this as "cultural lag," the 
        idea that culture takes time to adjust to material conditions.[<a href="#1">1</a>] 
        When one part of culture changes (in this case, the "material culture"), 
        other parts require readjustment, a process which could take years, during 
        which time there is a "maladjustment." We can see this delay after the 
        development of the car. By 1910 Henry Ford was mass-producing them, and 
        yet, as Frances Cairncross points out in <i>The Death of Distance</i>: 
      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>none of the social consequences of its development were apparent. The 
          physical landscape had yet to adjust: highways and out-of-town shopping 
          centres did not exist; suburbs sprawled only around railway stations; 
          and city centres were still lively hubs of commerce and industry. Not 
          only have the geographic consequences of the automobile taken most of 
          the century to unfold, so have the economic and social consequences 
          of increased personal mobility.[<a href="#2">2</a>] </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Cairncross goes on to highlight the changes the telephone, television 
        and (to a surprisingly lesser extent) the computer have had on the world 
        as their existence has gradually become part of normal life. Networked 
        computers, she adds, will also "revolutionise the productivity of up to 
        half the work force of the rich world."</p>
      <p>This is not to imply she sees the Internet as benefiting only the rich. 
        In fact she later claims it will benefit everyone: Both rich and developing 
        countries will benefit as the western world's demand for services employs 
        large numbers of remote workers; developing countries who liberalise their 
        markets will be able to make the most of their young and willing-to-learn 
        populations; and the poor will swiftly benefit from plummeting prices 
        and will gain access to the new communications networks, making the new 
        societies more inclusive than the old. </p>
      <p>While this world of unhindered trade and instant communication will benefit 
        all, she admits "the uneducated and the old will benefit less than the 
        well educated and the young."[<a href="#3">3</a>] Sohail Inayatullah and 
        Ivana Milojevic would go much further however, listing all those who will 
        be excluded: "non-English speaking nations, 'irrelevant' nations and peoples, 
        national, religious and ideological minorities, poor in poor countries 
        and poor in rich countries, the majority of women, most old and disabled, 
        and almost all children," going on to point out that even if they "catch 
        up with the dominating forces, it will be on their terms and it will be 
        in their language."[<a href="#4">4</a>] English is, of course, the language 
        which the excluded will be forced to use, and Cairncross doesn't disagree 
        with this, but couches it in rather more upbeat terms, seeing it as the 
        common (and inevitable) standard which will enable communications technology 
        to work efficiently. Some would argue that with a common language easing 
        the transmission of information, this will enable "foreign" cultures to 
        reach a wider audience; Luc Besson defended his decision to film The Messenger 
        (his story of Joan of Arc) in English with the claim that it will spread 
        knowledge of French culture further than anything in his native language 
        could.[<a href="#5">5</a>]</p>
      <p>Assuming a common language, the greatest benefit of the global communications 
        network will be the ease with which geographically separated people can 
        communicate. It is possible to "talk" with friends, relatives, colleagues 
        for next to no cost, no matter where they are in the world, and this, 
        says Cairncross, can only be a good thing, increasing knowledge of other 
        cultures, bringing people and businesses closer together, and bringing 
        us a step closer to world peace. There is little doubt that this "death 
        of distance" enables the blossoming of relationships that would not have 
        occurred before, but in gaining this are we losing something else? Inayatullah 
        and Milojevic would say so, insisting that "the end of distance is not 
        the creation of nearness, of intimacy, of community Š we can create virtual 
        communities far and away but still treat badly our neighbours, partners 
        and children." They paint a picture of individuals sitting at computers, 
        knowing no one but those whose values they share, in a virtual world which 
        excludes billions of the world's poor. </p>
      <p>Many believe we are already heading toward this scenario and a recent 
        study from the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society[<a href="#6">6</a>] 
        would seem to back this claim, stating that the more time people spend 
        using the Internet, the less they communicate with others in person or 
        through other means of communication. While a survey such as this is guaranteed 
        plenty of publicity, it has also met with much criticism. Jakob Nielsen, 
        the web usability guru, pointed out that the survey assumes contact via 
        the Internet is qualitatively worse than any other kind and ignores the 
        fact that there have been many other new technologies which absorbed the 
        time we may once have been spent chatting to our neighbours.[<a href="#7">7</a>] 
        Some would go so far as to say that most technologies in the modern world 
        have a detrimental effect on society as a whole, as Guy Debord claimed 
        in Society of the Spectacle: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The economic system founded on isolation is a circular production of 
          isolation. The technology is based on isolation, and the technical process 
          isolates in turn. From the automobile to television, all the goods selected 
          by the spectacular system are also its weapons for a constant reinforcement 
          of the conditions of isolation of "lonely crowds."[<a href="#8">8</a>] 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The survey also claims that thanks to the Internet, more people spend 
        time working at home. This reduces the quality of life, with people unable 
        to escape work. This conflation of home and work can easily be seen as 
        a benefit of new technology, however, not least by both Nielsen and Cairncross. 
        Going out to a place of work every day is, in a broad view of history, 
        an anomaly; before the Industrial Revolution required workers to be present 
        in the same place to churn out mass-produced goods, it was normal to work 
        at home, or failing that, near home. This trend towards home-working will, 
        says Cairncross, revitalise both cities and rural areas, with fewer workers 
        needing to commute long distances, more people living and working in urban 
        centres, and those once isolated in remote parts of the country now able 
        to access information and communicate with others more easily than ever 
        before. (Incidentally, this trend would seem to run counter to progressive 
        theories of social change which see civilisation becoming increasingly 
        isolating and moving away from the once traditional home as a location 
        for both work and family life.)</p>
      <p>The third main claim of the survey, picked up on by Nielsen and echoing 
        Cairncross's words mentioned earlier, is that there is a digital divide. 
        We have heard this generic term used before, but the study is precise 
        about where the division lies. While income level has a noticeable effect, 
        the main influences on whether or not people use the Internet are education 
        level and age. This brings us back to the matter of who will benefit most 
        from new communications technologies.</p>
      <p>One of the much vaunted benefits of the Internet over other media is 
        the reduced barrier to entry; it is now possible for anyone with a telephone 
        line and a computer to produce material for, or sell goods to, anyone 
        in the world. We should be under no illusions that everyone has the means 
        to achieve this, as highlighted in the Stanford report, but with barriers 
        dropping so low surely this access to a voice is a great equaliser? Marx 
        and Engles famously said </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The class which has the means of material production at its disposal 
          has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so 
          that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means 
          of mental production are subject to it.[9] </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So can we say there are now vastly more people with access to the means 
        of material production and hence of mental production? Certainly, if we 
        adjust the idea of "material production" for a world in which services 
        are increasingly the major product, it is simple for many more people 
        to "produce." But does it still follow that in doing so these people will 
        have a great influence on the world's ideas? </p>
      <p>There are indeed people who have an influence on the world who may not 
        have done so before the Internet. Look at any number of enthusiastic programmers, 
        such as Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, or Marc Andreessen, one 
        of Netscape's founders, to see how one person's idea can have a huge impact 
        in the networked world. However, are these examples substantially different 
        from other people who have had huge impacts on the world before computers? 
        There have been any number of inventors whose products and ideas have 
        changed the world. </p>
      <p>Perhaps, then, we should look at how easy it is for people to make their 
        voices heard now, compared to when the only media available required large 
        investments of capital to establish. Undoubtedly, there are cases where 
        a lone voice has been heard which may have been lost before the Web become 
        commonplace -- Matt Drudge, the gossip columnist who broke the Monica 
        Lewinsky scandal, for example. However, to say all people have equal access 
        to a "voice" would assume that they are on a level with all the traditional 
        media outlets. Will the majority of people be as open to this voice as 
        they are to any existing brand, whether this brand is a large media company, 
        an individual product, or a celebrity? While it's certainly easier to 
        get your voice heard, to say that you, along with all the other freshly 
        clamouring voices, are able to have as forceful an impact as the established 
        voices within the system is not true. Certainly, it is easier to reach 
        a relatively large number of people (but still a niche market in global 
        terms), but this does not mean everyone will be on an equal footing with 
        large companies already established. In fact, we must not overlook the 
        fact that the nature of the networked world also makes it easier for established 
        brands to reach new audiences. </p>
      <p>It is, of course, impossible to pin down the effects the Internet will 
        or won't have on society at this early stage in its development, thanks 
        to cultural lag. On the one hand, Frances Cairncross's networked world 
        will bring everyone closer together, revitalise and humanise the physical 
        environment, allow everyone to be heard and create a more free and peaceful 
        world. On the other hand, this is yet another technology moving everything 
        which was directly lived away into a representation (to paraphrase Guy 
        Debord). It is creating a world of "lonely crowds," of disenfranchised 
        whose only hope of joining the new civilisation ("new" only in form rather 
        than content) is to learn an alien language and customs. </p>
