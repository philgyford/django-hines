      <p>The concept of ideational social change, that is, how ideas can cause 
        change, didn't, for me, sit easily compared to other theories of change. 
        While progressive theories describe how society builds on previous achievements, 
        always improving, and technology-based theories describe how new technology 
        can result in dramatic changes in the structure of society, ideational 
        theories seemed to be describing a different concept altogether. It seemed 
        to me that descriptions of how ideas spread through a society (whether 
        that be a nation, a town or a company) were merely describing the effects 
        caused by something else. I could see that technology might cause change: 
        a new method of ploughing might improve crop yields, leading to surplus 
        food which could be sold, allowing farmers to improve their standard of 
        living, for example. But it seemed to me that ideational theories were 
        merely describing how this change, the knowledge of how to plough using 
        this new method, might spread to other farmers. I couldn't see how ideas 
        could be the cause of change; they seemed like things which were affected 
        by change.</p>
      <p><a name="1b"></a>I had these thoughts at the back of my mind for a couple 
        of weeks, trying to make sense of them and then, within the space of a 
        week, they began to make sense. At the recent SXSW conference in Austin, 
        Stewart Brand gave a keynote speech about his Long Now Foundation.[<a href="#1">1</a>] 
        The idea behind this is that humans seem to be concentrating increasingly 
        on things that change rapidly, while the real power is in things that 
        change slowly. As an illustration he showed a diagram which illustrated 
        how different things change at different speeds, in order from slow to 
        fast: nature, culture, governance, infrastructure, commerce, fashion. 
        Depending on how these are defined, I would question some of the ordering, 
        but the point remains. One danger of this concentration on the faster 
        things is that only those people who are able to keep up will know how 
        the world works. If you're not at the cutting edge you'll be at a distinct 
        disadvantage. </p>
      <p>Brand was describing a world in which ideas are spreading ever more quickly, 
        in which there is an insatiable appetite for trivial and ephemeral information 
        at the expense of the meaningful and substantial. I was also reading <i>Miss 
        Wyoming</i> by Douglas Coupland, and another part of the puzzle slipped 
        suddenly into place. One character, Randy, spends his evenings feeding</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><a name="2b"></a>thousands of deceptions into a Dell PC which multiplied 
          them like viruses, out into the world of electrons. Most of his rumours 
          died, but some became self-fulfilling prophecies. Who could have known 
          that young ingenue truly was so ripe to become a compulsive handwasher?[<a href="#2">2</a>]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Not only was this describing the spread of ideas, via the gossip-hungry 
        denizens of the Internet, but it was describing a source of ideas. Previously 
        I'd only been able to conceive of ideas being caused by other changes, 
        yet this was the birthplace of new information. This paragraph was describing 
        memes, Richard Dawkins' concept of ideas as entities which evolve and 
        propagate through a culture just as genes do in the physical world. Memes 
        could be stories like those Randy creates and lets loose onto the Internet, 
        akin to the urban legends which spread and re-occur time and time again. 
        Or they could be catchphrases, such as Homer Simpson's trademark "Doh!", 
        which spread far from their source. Or traditions, ways of doing business, 
        fashions... and these all had to start somewhere, just as in evolution 
        there must have been a creature that could be described as the first entity 
        to be alive. Just as that creature evolved and spread over time and space, 
        so these ideas began somewhere and then dispersed. I was beginning to 
        understand how ideational change could describe not just the effect, but 
        also the cause of change.</p>
      <p><a name="3b"></a>Then, as all this began to make sense, I read a review[<a href="#3">3</a>] 
        of Malcolm Gladwell's new book <i>The Tipping Point</i> which describes 
        the spread of ideas in terms of epidemiology. Suddenly I knew I was on 
        the right track. At first it had seemed that descriptions of spreading 
        ideas (whether the metaphor is viruses or genes) were describing the spread 
        of some new, say, technological, change. Now it seemed clear that this 
        technological change itself was caused by an idea, and it was this original 
        idea that was spreading. It's a subtle difference. To continue the earlier 
        example, I had originally seen the plough as a technological development 
        which occurred somewhere and then ideational change would merely be describing 
        the new plough concept. Now I realised that the new plough didn't simply 
        occur, but was caused by an idea, and it was this original idea that was 
        spreading</p>
      <p><a name="4b"></a>So, how exactly do ideas begin? If we're talking about 
        a virus-like idea which many people in a society have caught, where did 
        it begin, who is its patient zero? In his 1997 <i>New Yorker</i> article 
        'The Coolhunters'[<a href="#4">4</a>] , Gladwell described Baysie and 
        DeeDee, two "coolhunters" working for sneaker companies whose job was 
        to search out what the coolest kids were into, and report back so next 
        season's styles would be in step with emerging fashions. It's a search 
        for the origin of a trend, finding out what will be big, what everyone 
        will one day be wearing or doing, in order to remain ahead.</p>
      <p>As an example of the emergence of a new idea Gladwell recounts the story 
        of two classic Hush Puppy styles. These, the Duke and the Columbia, were 
        selling only 65,000 pairs per year and the company was trying to move 
        away from what they saw as an old fashioned suede look. However, someone 
        told the Hush Puppy executives that these styles were becoming popular 
        in parts of New York, that they were being bought from small stores as 
        authentic and original shoes, a move away from modernity. Soon, in 1994, 
        they found these styles were popular with major fashion designers, and 
        film stars in Los Angeles began asking for them. This fashion spread swiftly 
        and in 1995 430,000 pairs were sold, rising to 1,600,000 the following 
        year. And the revival was only just beginning in the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>It's not just in the fickle and swift-moving world of fashion that ideas 
        emerge and spread rapidly through society. In <i>Extraordinary Popular 
        Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</i>, Charles Mackay recounts the birth 
        of "Tulipomania," the incredible boom in the market for tulips in the 
        17th century. The flower had been popular in Constantinople for many years, 
        and Conrad Gesner claims to have been the first to spot tulips in Augsburg, 
        Germany in 1559 in the garden of Counsellor Herwart, a well known collector. 
        For maybe a dozen years after, the wealthy in Germany and Holland sent 
        for the flowers from Constantinople, and the first to be planted in England 
        arrived from Vienna in 1600. The tulip became increasingly popular and 
        by 1634 all wealthy men of taste were expected to have a collection of 
        the flowers. From here the fashion spread through society:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><a name="5b"></a>The rage for possessing them soon caught the middle 
          classes of society, and merchants and shopkeepers, even of moderate 
          means, began to vie with each other in the rarity of these flowers and 
          the preposterous prices they paid for them.[<a href="#5">5</a>]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The way this craze for tulips spread, from an expert to an increasingly 
        large number of those with a high social status and then on to the rest 
        of society, echoes the pattern found in the classic diffusion research 
        study, and all such studies since. In 1943 Bryce Ryan and Neal C. Gross 
        conducted interviews with hundreds of farmers in Iowa to examine the adoption 
        of hybrid corn. This corn had many advantages to traditional varieties, 
        but it required the farmers to change their behaviour as they had to buy 
        new stocks every year rather than keep seeds from their current crop to 
        sow the following year. All but two of the 259 farmers included in the 
        final study adopted the new corn in the 13 years between 1928 and 1941. 
        In the first five years only 10 percent used it, but three years later 
        this was up to 40 percent. The rate of adoption then slowed over the remaining 
        years. Plotting the accumulated number of farmers using hybrid corn creates 
        an S-curve, a shape which would also apply to the fashion for classic 
        Hush Puppies or the craze for tulips.</p>
      <p><a name="6b"></a>The farmers who adopted hybrid corn in the first few 
        years, the early adopters, were generally wealthier, better educated and 
        more cosmopolitan compared to the later adopters, further up the S-curve. 
        We can break the categories of adopters down further, as Everett M. Rogers 
        does in <i>Diffusion of Innovations</i>[<a href="#6">6</a>]. For example, 
        the very first adopters of something are Innovators, who are willing to 
        take a chance on something new, perhaps from outside the system. These 
        are the people Gladwell's coolhunters are seeking. However, Innovators 
        aren't able to lead opinion, to persuade the rest of society to follow 
        their lead. This is up to the Early Adopters who have the respect of more 
        people, and who will provide an evaluation of the new idea upon which 
        the next in line, the Early Majority, can decide whether to take up the 
        innovation.</p>
      <p>Obviously, if these sections of society are setting the trends they are 
        extremely influential, and this is recognised by more people than the 
        coolhunters. Viral marketing is a technique, similar to word-of-mouth, 
        that can be used to spread the word about a new product or service. Virgin 
        Net, an internet service provider in the UK, used this method successfully 
        for a promotional scheme as described in this email to the UK Net Marketing 
        mailing list:</p>
      <blockquote><tt> 
        <p><font size="-1">Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2000 18:29:25 +0000<br>
          From: Jo Peat<br>
          Organization: Virgin Net<br>
          To: uk-netmarketing@chinwag.com<br>
          Subject: Re: UKNM: benign viruses</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">We ran a very sucessful viral marketing campaign with 
          the Virgin Net cinema ticket giveaway.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">We emailed just 25 opinion formers and all 20,000 tickets 
          were snapped up in less than three hours. At its peak we received 450 
          emails a minute, demand outstipping reply by about 2 to 1. Requests 
          even arrived 6 hours after the promotion ended.</font></p>
       </tt></blockquote>
      <p>This technique shows the influence of a society's Early Adopters, but 
        bypasses the Innovators stage. While the coolhunters are out looking for 
        new ideas developing among the Innovators, which they will then package 
        and market to the Early Adopters, this case of viral marketing is relying 
        on a basic idea which already obviously exists -- the desire for free 
        cinema tickets.</p>
      <p>So now it seems clear how ideas can cause change, as ideas are the basis 
        of all other changes. While technology can facilitate change, and its 
        progress depends on existing technology, someone must have an idea in 
        order for developments to take place, and this is what will spread, meme- 
        or virus-like through society.</p>
      <p>An interesting side-effect of my revelations echo Thomas S. Kuhn's concept 
        of scientific revolutions. He believed that it was impossible to view 
        the world through an old paradigm once you had found a new one. For example, 
        once Einstein's theories were developed it was impossible to see the world 
        purely through Newton's theories. Similarly, I now find it difficult to 
        see how I could have not understood the creation of new ideas only a week 
        ago!</p>
