      <p> <b>Alternative futures</b></p>
      <p>Using two uncertainties concerning price of oil and the number of home 
        workers in a GBN-style matrix. Four scenarios for 2010.</p>
      <p><b><i>1. Island suburbs -- many home workers, the price of oil has risen 
        dramatically.</i></b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Maisy has been working from home for several years now. Her company 
          offered telecommuting as an option to all phone operatives a long time 
          ago, but it wasn't until the price of oil shot up the first time that 
          she decided to give it a try. It was tough at first, stuck in her sprawling 
          neighbourhood day after day, resisting the temptation to use the car 
          as often as she'd like to visit the office or go shopping or just drive 
          the few miles to the nearest mall to meet up with friends. But more 
          and more people in her neighbourhood have started working from home, 
          one by one deciding they can't afford to make the daily car trips to 
          work any more, so they meet up at each others houses for lunch sometimes. 
          The city started a regular (gas-powered) bus service to downtown last 
          year now the demand is there, although it's still a twenty minute walk 
          to the main road from Maisy's end of the development.</p>
        <p>Next month though the new shopping centre opens on the previously vacant 
          land between this neighbourhood and the next. Well, it's more than just 
          a shopping centre, with offices and some small apartments above the 
          stores too. Maisy's looking forward to being able to walk to the shops 
          again, especially with the delivery charges for all the estores going 
          up so much the last few years. Maybe she can find a job there that'll 
          let her meet people for a change! It would be good to get out of the 
          house more often, as being cooped up in the same place 24 hours a day 
          with her husband can get a bit much at times. He decided to go back 
          to college, and even though it's only the other side of town he studies 
          from home most of the time as it works out cheaper. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><i>2. Standing room only -- few home workers, the price of oil has 
        risen dramatically.</i></b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Another wait in the dark for the train. Ben's been getting up earlier 
          than ever recently, as the trains have become increasingly crowded. 
          Unless you get to the station for 7am they're full by the time they 
          pull in here on the way to downtown. He can hardly believe everyone 
          used to drive to work; he's only been out of school a couple of years 
          and the price of oil went through the roof a long time before then. 
          He went to a university that was only on the other side of town, but 
          he got a room there as the rent was cheaper than driving from his parents' 
          house every day. When he left university he had to turn down the perfect 
          job offer because it was at an office complex by the mall and with no 
          public transport going there he couldn't afford to drive on the entry 
          salary. He couldn't afford to replace his old car with an electric model, 
          like his parents did when they passed it on to him, but he plans to 
          do so soon.</p>
        <p>Until then he squeezes onto the train early every morning. They say 
          they're upgrading the lines to allow for more trains, using money diverted 
          from the hurriedly aborted roads program. The long train journey takes 
          him past the really expensive housing closer to the business district. 
          It doesn't seem long ago that these were run down inner city areas, 
          but as gas prices rose the idea of living close to the centre of town 
          became more appealing. Anyone who could afford to moved away from their 
          sprawling and distant suburbs to town houses and apartments above shops 
          that went rapidly upmarket.</p>
        <p>It's so different from Ben's neighbourhood; no one wants to live there 
          now, with little chance of finding work nearby, and the prospect of 
          an expensive or crowded commute every day. His neighbour tried working 
          from home for a while, just before he moved away, but he couldn't take 
          the isolation and felt cut off from the people who still went into the 
          office every day. Ben doesn't like the idea either. It may be an uncomfortable 
          journey to work, but it's better than spending every day alone in the 
          house without even a corner store within walking distance.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><i><a name="3"></a>3. Business as usual -- few home workers, the price 
        of oil stays steady.</i></b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Another day, another traffic jam. It's taking Terry longer and longer 
          to get into work each day and she regrets buying a place so far away 
          from work now. But it's a lovely house, plenty of garden and greenery, 
          a long way from the pollution of the more crowded parts of town. Still, 
          it could be worse; quite a few people have electric cars these days, 
          although not as many as the government predicted; with gas still affordable 
          most people have stuck with what they know, although the younger kids 
          seem to be taking to the EVs more. But even these add to the congestion. 
          The city extended its light rail system a few years ago, but most people 
          still prefer to sit in their own cars rather than park and ride, even 
          though driving takes so long. Besides, housing close to the light rail 
          has shot up in price, especially since they introduced all the traffic 
          restrictions in the area.</p>
        <p>Some days Terry works from home, but only occasionally, when she needs 
          to concentrate on a project. It's no problem with video conferencing 
          and everything, but she couldn't do it all the time. But she may have 
          to stay home more often if the city restricts car traffic into town, 
          like they're threatening to do. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><i>4. Moving on out -- many home workers, the price of oil stays steady.</i></b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Not long ago Danny moved away from his old neighbourhood to this new 
          place further out. The old place had seemed spacious and a break from 
          the city when he moved in, but over the years all the new development 
          in the area made it seem like any old neighbourhood, especially with 
          all the extra traffic it brought. So he moved even further out to this 
          brand new suburb, and just in time too; prices began to plummet in the 
          old neighbourhood, what with so many people wanting to move further 
          away.</p>
        <p>It's a hell of a long way to drive to most places now of course, but 
          that's not a big problem for Danny. He's been working from home for 
          years and doesn't miss office life one bit. He can sit at the far end 
          of the garden and imagine he's in the countryside, all the time still 
          in close contact with his workmates (most of whom are working from their 
          homes too). He goes into the office maybe once a week, to touch base 
          and meet clients face to face; it's a couple of hours drive, assuming 
          average levels of congestion, but that's OK.</p>
        <p>It can get lonely of course, but he often drives to visit friends or 
          meet up at one of the malls that have followed the residential development 
          out into the countryside. </p>
