      <p><i><b>Infinite Jest</b></i><b>, David Foster Wallace, Little, Brown & 
        Company, 1996.</b></p>
      <p>This hefty novel (981 pages, plus 96 pages of footnotes) is set an indeterminate 
        number of years in the future, although few would call it science-fiction; 
        it just happens to be set an indeterminate number of years in the future 
        which contributes to its atmosphere of dislocation. It has been described 
        as</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>the longest novel about tennis ever published. It is also a dystopian 
          political satire set on a North American continent menaced by paraplegic 
          Quebecois terrorists and splintered into new territorial arrangements, 
          the most wildly metaphorical anatomy of drug abuse since William Burroughs's 
          Naked Lunch, and a tender, heartfelt, coming-of-age story.[<a href="#1">1</a>]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Just as the narrative strands intertwine and gradually emerge throughout 
        the novel, so the world in which they occur is filled in a little at a 
        time. In the interests of clarity then, it would be useful to bring together 
        and summarise the main features of the scenario.</p>
      <p>It is impossible to pin down in which year the events happen due to the 
        advent of Subsidised Time. At a time which would seem to be in the first 
        few years of the new century, it became possible for companies to sponsor 
        individual years, the first such year being Year of the Whopper and the 
        year in which most of the novel takes place, seven years later, being 
        Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment.[<a href="#2">2</a>] This separation 
        of the two eras makes it impossible to tell how far in the future the 
        story is set, but there are a number of events which are described as 
        occurring before Subsidised Time which would require a few years to happen, 
        so we can assume much of the action occurs maybe 15 years after the book 
        was published.</p>
      <p>What we know of these years is sketchy, and often recounted by unreliable 
        sources (such as, in one case, a puppet show). One major change in the 
        US is the complete destruction and rebirth of televisual entertainment. 
        Thanks to the fickleness of remote-controlled TV viewing and VCRs which 
        can avoid the commercials the four big TV networks begin to suffer from 
        lack of ad revenue while the regional and national cable networks form 
        the American Council of Disseminators of Cable. The ACDC convinces the 
        public that it is their American right to have 500-plus channels to choose 
        from, and they soon begin raking in the advertising revenues which allow 
        them to purchase premier sporting events, sealing their popularity further, 
        and eventually (in 1999) driving the traditional networks off the air.[<a href="#3">3</a>] 
        Areas of the country which do not yet have access to cable TV see their 
        crime and suicide rates rise dramatically as previously network TV watching 
        citizens realise they have nothing to do with their time. The moribund 
        broadcast networks combine their resources behind a company created by 
        a video rental mogul and form InterLace TelEntertainment, offering pay-per-view 
        entertainment viewable on TV or computer, via modem, fibre-optic cable 
        or mailable diskettes. This gives viewers even more choice, the ACDC companies 
        decline, InterLace TelEnt expands its infrastructure, and sometime after 
        the advent of the Subsidised Era the government considers nationalising 
        the company. There is something strangely retro about this new entertainment 
        format, and the prevalence of diskettes of TV shows, or one's daily news 
        stories, arriving in the mail seems particularly quaint.</p>
      <p>The other major change is political and geographical; it would seem that 
        NATO dismantled itself, deciding there was no point existing without an 
        enemy, and the United States, Canada and Mexico formed the Organisation 
        of North American Nations (ONAN). Following this, sometime just after 
        the introduction of Subsidised Time, it becomes apparent there are horrendous 
        problems with waste in the north-east USA; vast amounts of refuse, much 
        of it dangerous industrial and medical waste, is polluting a sizeable 
        part of the country, but no one knows who is to blame. The waste generated 
        by annular fusion (a technology which has allowed the USA to become energy-independent) 
        only exacerbates the problem, and not wanting to be saddled with vast 
        tracts of uncleanable land the US government comes up with a novel solution: 
        they give the area to Canada as a gift, in return for which they only 
        ask that they be allowed to continue dumping their waste in the area.[<a href="#4">4</a>] 
        The area, henceforth known as the Great Concavity/Convexity, is evacuated 
        and surrounded by Lucite walls and checkpoints, and appears to be the 
        spark which ignites the aforementioned paraplegic and other more able-bodied 
        Quebecois terrorists' demands for independence. Annula fusion waste has 
        the effect of making the land super-fertile, to the point that it would 
        get way out of control, but this growth is combated by the contents of 
        the Empire Waste Displacement displacement vehicles -- large trash receptacles 
        which are flung deep into the Great Concavity from the USA at an altitude 
        of more than three miles by block-long catapults.</p>
      <p>Aside from these scenario-setting reports there is a particularly interesting 
        and hilarious description of the social effects of the rise and fall of 
        a new technology: video phones.[<a href="#5">5</a>] The main problem was 
        the stress caused by callers suddenly having to see each other.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Good old traditional audio-only phone conversations allowed you to 
          presume that the person on the other end was paying complete attention 
          to you while also permitting you not to have to pay anything even close 
          to complete attention to her ... consumers began to see [visual-video 
          telephone calls] were less like having the good old phone ring than 
          having the doorbell ring and having to throw on clothes and attach prostheses 
          and do hair-checks in the foyer mirror before answering the door.<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This was compounded when people realised how bad they looked when filmed 
        by the small and cheap cameras with which video phones were equipped. 
        The first solution was an expensive procedure of constructing a three 
        dimensional computer model of the user wearing an earnest expression and 
        looking their best. This was soon replaced by cheaper form-fitting masks 
        designed to look good on camera which seemed like a viable solution, despite 
        mistaken-identity problems with callers accidentally putting on the wrong 
        masks occasionally. Inevitably, people soon began wanting to look even 
        better, and began to have masks made which enhanced their features. This, 
        however, lead to a raising of expectations amongst masked video-phone 
        callers so that many became scared of meeting correspondents in person, 
        sans enhanced masks.</p>
      <p>Problems intensified when cameras improved in quality and began framing 
        a wider field of vision. This created a market for full-body 'masks,' 
        two dimensional cut-outs of handsome and attractive bodies suitable for 
        video calls. From this it was a small step to the creation of Transmittable 
        Tableaux, photographs of a whole room which were clipped over the camera 
        lens.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Facial and bodily masking could now be dispensed with altogether and 
          replaced with the video-transmitted image of what was essentially a 
          heavily doctored still-photograph, one of an incredibly fit and attractive 
          and well-turned-out human being, someone who actually resembled you 
          the caller only in such limited respects as like race and limb-number, 
          the photo's face focused attentively in the direction of the video-phonic 
          camera from amid the sumptuous but not ostentatious appointments of 
          the sort of room that best reflected the image of yourself you wanted 
          to transmit, etc.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It wasn't long before most people saw no point in the expense of transmitting 
        still photos down video-fibre lines and audio-only phones became popular 
        once again, as "a status-symbol of anti-vanity, such that only callers 
        utterly lacking in self-awareness continued to use videophony and Tableaux."</p>
      <p>The setting of Infinite Jest is, in some respects superfluous to the 
        plots, in that much of the story is about people whose lives would be 
        little different were it set in the present day. However, by shifting 
        the tale an unspecified distance into the future, when the world is different 
        enough to be a little unfamiliar, it provides a sense of unease that would 
        otherwise not be present. While the background stories of ONAN and InterLace 
        TelEnt are in some ways divorced from the central action, they do have 
        an affect on the characters' lives to some extent; characters are always 
        aware of their refuse (the waste containers on the streets, the displacement 
        vehicles flying overhead) and the media, both contemporary and pre-InterLace 
        play an important part in their lives. However, we see little of the effects 
        on the rest of the population, with much of the action confined within 
        the boundaries of a tennis academy and a half-way house.</p>
      <p>The future developments are often on the boundaries between plausibility 
        and ridiculousness, which is a good position to be in to encourage thinking 
        about the future: too plausible and one tends to simply accept an event 
        as possible without thinking about it; too ridiculous and one may well 
        dismiss it out of hand as too far-fetched to ever happen. Items such as 
        Subsidised Time, the collapse and rebirth of the TV networks and the allocation 
        of a large area solely as a waste dump may seem unlikely, but with plausible 
        intervening steps they seem like thought-provoking possibilities. </p>

        out of the Statue of Liberty in giant diapers, was a boom in the share 
        prices of companies in the calendar and pre-printed check industries, 
        which is a nice little aside on further effects of these changes, and
