      <p><b>'Things Fall Apart,' from New Media Knowledge's <i>Report From the 
        Future</i>, October 1999</b></p>
      <p>'Things Fall Apart' is one of four scenarios generated in an effort to 
        forecast possible futures for the UK new media industry in 2004. The 1999 
        project was supported by New Media Knowledge (a publicly-funded organisation) 
        and London's SUN-ICA New Media Centre. Given the speed with which the 
        Internet industry is developing, the organisers made an effort to condense 
        the usually lengthy scenario-planning exercise into as short a time as 
        possible, while still allowing contributions and discussions from many 
        sources.</p>
      <p>To this end, the first stage of the project, christened 'Living Scenarios,' 
        was an online discussion forum where 200 people were invited to take part 
        in an ongoing brainstorm. This also, in theory but, as they discovered, 
        not necessarily in practice, allowed people to become familiar with each 
        other in a short space of time, before meeting in the flesh for the second 
        phase. This consisted of a one-day event at which the scenarios themselves 
        were created. The final, ongoing, stage of 'Living Scenarios' (which takes 
        place after the publication of the initial scenarios) is a series of monthly 
        planning sessions to keep track of emerging trends and events.</p>
      <p>This scenario is the most detailed of the quartet which emerged from 
        this process, and is certainly the most pessimistic. It describes how 
        the Internet bubble burst in a big way, with the public and industry realising 
        many .com companies had little going for them. Market demand failed to 
        grow at anything like projected rates, and a huge fraud investigation 
        into an online pensions company instigated a series of drastic governmental 
        reforms. The morning following the publishing of a White Paper imposing 
        heavy taxes, licences and restrictions, the share prices of new media 
        companies fell 70 per cent. This was 2003, and TV companies had already 
        been expanding their technologies and introducing their own proprietary 
        satellite-, digital- and cable-based networks which were far more attractive 
        and reliable for the public than the chaotic Internet.</p>
      <p>The chronology of 'Things Fall Apart' is written as the reminiscences 
        of David Smith, a computer programmer thinking back to the good old days 
        and what went wrong. The four scenarios are designed by and for the British 
        new media industry so perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that networks 
        and electronics are their focus. However, they suffer from this narrow 
        view and even this, the longest of the four, lacks colour and memorable 
        images. It adequately describes the gradual collapse of an industry, but 
        seems too bland for many causes or incidents to stick in one's memory. 
        This may in part be due to the scenarios' tight focus at the expense of 
        other areas of life; only one scenario gives an impression of what every 
        day life might be like, and in this the suicidal man surrounded by an 
        automated home doesn't encourage one to identify with him! There is little 
        describing personal futures and thus the scenarios have a tendency to 
        seem slightly abstract and distant, unless the reader is concerned about 
        the future position of his/her new media company. Which may of course 
        be the sole intention.</p>
      <p>Why is this? It could be that there was limited space in which to publish 
        the scenarios, so they had to be brief, and tightly focused. There may 
        well have been descriptions of the everyday life which we miss in the 
        final form. On the other hand, it sounded like the large number of contributors 
        were all drawn from the new media industry and perhaps more "outsiders" 
        would have generated more variety. In fact, the report expresses surprise 
        at the level of consensus found within the group:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Bandwidth will increase. Browsers will improve. Hardware will be upgraded. 
          Legislation will be benign. Laden down with share options, our boat 
          will still come in."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Perhaps the narrow experience of the participants and the short period 
        of time taken to generate the scenarios restricted the amount of "out-of-the-box" 
        thinking that went on. A wider variety of viewpoints on technology, and 
        more time spent encouraging fresh thinking may have created more varied, 
        useful and in-depth scenarios.</p>
