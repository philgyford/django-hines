        <li><b>Fleshing out scenarios</b>
<br><i>(IV) - 2010: Generation Y are fickle and disregard most advertising, while illegal online distribution of digital music cannot be stopped.</i>
<ul>
<li>Crazes for bands begin 'underground,' by distribution of MP3s/whatever among fans looking for new music.
<li>CD sales dropped.
<li>Less tech-savvy, the wealthy, and those with less time to spare, still pay for original, official music, eg, Boomers.
<li>Huge stars are created and then disappear in short time frames.
<li>Increasing sponsorship and less upfront methods of promoting music.
<li>Music companies co-opted illegal distribution forums, eg Napster, Gnutella, as a new means of distribution.
<li>Music companies using illegal distribution forums as test-beds and ways to begin promotion of new artists.
<li>Companies make more money from selling merchandise, websites, games, movies, access to stars.
<li>Computer-generated stars, fine tuned to today's tastes. People are fans of CGI stars' creators, rather than the stars themselves.
<li>Music which is brand new isn't available via illegal methods, so people will pay for the truly cutting edge stuff.
<li>Secure music formats succeed if they tap into a current fad?
<li>Gen Y are now aged 16-31, voting, buying houses, starting to have children.
<li>More non-domestic stars.
<li>Too much music available - how to choose? Word of mouth, recommendation agents?
<li>Shoutcast-style personal broadcasting very popular. Very diverse stations, 'broadcast' to many devices.
<li>Knowing about something really new and obscure is a mark of status.
<li>Emergence of style leaders, opinion formers.
