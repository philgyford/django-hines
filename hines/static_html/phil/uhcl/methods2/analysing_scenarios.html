      <p><b>'Now for a really conservative century' by Andrew Marr, <i>New Statesman 
        and Society</i>, 2000-01-03, pp45-47.</b></p>
      <p>Before launching into a possible scenario for the 21st century (mainly 
        for the United Kingdom), the article begins with a description of the 
        20th. It has been described as "the Conservative Century" due to the number 
        of years the Conservative party has been in power, but Marr goes on to 
        point out how it could more qualitatively be described as a progressive, 
        centre-left century:</p>
      <p>This was the century, after all, when women got the vote, when trade 
        unions rose to the height of their power, when the welfare state was constructed, 
        when wealth taxes and substantial income taxation were introduced, when 
        full employment was made an explicit part of government policy.</p>
      <p>Rather than seeing the next hundred years continuing this theme, however, 
        he describes the reasons why we could see a drastic shift to the right. 
        Nations are now weaker with their economic, environmental, and defence 
        powers restricted by supra-national organisations such as the WTO, Rio 
        convention and NATO respectively. Despite the 20th century's egalitarian 
        steps, the economic extremes are providing fuel for a new conservatism: 
        the super-rich have fewer ties to culture and nationality and the poor 
        largely ignore party politics but if anything are more likely to associate 
        with nationalist and right-wing causes. Further, populations are ageing 
        which is more likely to produce heavy conservative votes and larger Hindu 
        and Muslim populations could affect traditionally liberal, anti-censorship 
        cultures.</p>
      <p>A weak point in the description of a future is Marr's description of 
        rising environmentalism, for which he gives little in the way of supporting 
        trends or explicit causes. Interestingly he sees this as a conservative 
        reaction, rather than a radical left-leaning one, resulting in "new puritans" 
        for whom conspicuous consumption becomes socially unacceptable and who 
        demand "better public transport, fewer cars and more expensive organic 
        food." This is more along the lines of conservation and traditionalism, 
        rather than radical environmentalism. But either way, he sees it having 
        a dramatic social effect on society, with travel and immigration restricted 
        as countries attempt to live within their means. This traditionalism rears 
        its head again as a reaction to the increasing pace of scientific development, 
        similar to the public outcry over genetically modified foods. </p>
      <p>In the expanding knowledge economy the poor and uneducated suffer greatly, 
        unable to join in with the creation of wealth and flow of information 
        the rest of the country takes for granted. This increasing segregation 
        is a positive feedback loop, and governments don't help matters by altering 
        policies towards less progressive taxation, charges for public services, 
        and the privatisation of pensions and insurance.</p>
      <p>Marr goes so far as to suggest dates for certain crucial events over 
        the next few decades:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>2017, the first British National Movement MPs are elected.<br>
          2024, the abolition of income tax and the introduction of food stamps 
          for the poor.<br>
          2032, the reintroduction of the death penalty following a referendum.<br>
          2050, private cars are abolished and international travel restricted.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He summarises the condition of the world thus:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>A next century that is dominated by self-righteous puritans, unprepared 
          to pay general taxes to lift the rest of the population out of poverty, 
          picky and suspicious of government action; where national governments 
          are weaker economically but are required to be tougher in fighting crime 
          and limiting migration; and where macroeconomic management has moved 
          so far up to the global level that it is hardly connected to national 
          democracies at all.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As a political commentator and journalist, Andrew Marr is basing his 
        thoughts more on observation of trends and possible outcomes rather than 
        statistics, allowing him a slightly freer and more imaginative scenario 
        than he might otherwise have come up with. One significant flaw is the 
        vagueness of the location he's describing; at times he seems to be describing 
        Britain, other times what we assume is the western world, rather than 
        the whole world. Clarification of this, and supporting more of his statements 
        with current trends leading towards them, would have made for a more robust 
        and believable scenario.</p>
