      <p><b>Description</b></p>
      <p>&quot;Malibu ... is the wildfire capital of North America and, possibly, 
        the world. Fire here has a relentless staccato rhythm, syncopated by landslides 
        and floods. the rugged 22-mile-long coastline is scourged, on the average, 
        by a large fire (one thousand acres plus) every two and a half years, 
        and the entire surface area of the western Santa Monica Mountains has 
        been burnt three times over this century. At least once a decade a blaze 
        in the chaparral grows into a terrifying firestorm consuming hundreds 
        of homes in an inexorable advance across the mountains to the sea.&quot;<br>
        <i>Ecology of Fear</i>, Mike Davis, pp97-99.</p>
      <p>These fires are not a random event, and the potential is there for humans 
        to play a large part in controlling them. Before settlers arrived in the 
        area the local inhabitants regularly set fire to areas of the forest in 
        a controlled attempt to burn away the vegetation which accumulated. This 
        dead biomass is a vital fuel for fires and destroying it on a regular 
        basis reduced the chance of accidental, and uncontrollable, fire breaking 
        out. Since 1919 however, there has been an official policy of &quot;total 
        fire suppression,&quot; meaning that no fires should be allowed at all. 
        The growing levels of fuel increase the chances of fire breaking out each 
        year. And when fire does occur it's far more severe than it would otherwise 
        be, thanks to the large amount of fuel available. This behaviour is illustrated 
        in the graph below.</p>
      <p><img src="model1.gif" width="423" height="237" border="0" alt="Behaviour over time graph"></p>
      <p>The increasing amount of building in the mountains also has an effect 
        on disasters, and not just due to the proximity of humans prone to accidentally 
        starting fires. Fire-fighters have a harder time reaching crucial locations 
        due to the narrow winding roads favoured by the mountains' inhabitants. 
        Also, fire crews must concentrate not only on controlling the fire as 
        a whole but also saving individual houses, tasks which do not always go 
        hand in hand. While many properties have been destroyed over the decades, 
        this has not halted the urbanisation of this wilderness which has been 
        free of any kind of fire-risk zoning. In fact, the disasters only encourage 
        more construction: each one will be followed by re-building with the aid 
        of relaxed landuse regulations and even the fire code. The worst fires 
        will cause the area to be declared a federal disaster area bringing in 
        tax relief and low-interest loans.</p>

        <li>Each time interval equals one month, with rainfall and temperature

        <li>The frequency of controlled burning should be set between 0 and 1, 
          0 being the current &quot;total fire suppression&quot; policy and 1
