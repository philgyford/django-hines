      <p><b>The urban development of farmland in California's Central Valley</b>

        <a href="examples3_big.gif" title="Click for larger version"><img src="examples3.gif" width="361" height="271" border="0" alt="The urban development of farmland in California's Central Valley"></a></p>
      <p>The 400 mile long stretch of central California that is the Central Valley 
        has one of the highest rates of development in the country, with farmland 
        being paved over to construct new residential suburbs and giant retail 
        outlets. In terms of city income, this has both beneficial and detrimental 
        effects.</p>
      <p>Increased development attracts more people, thus increasing revenue for 
        the city (whether from property tax, sales tax or utility fees). However, 
        the previously agricultural land requires new infrastructure to be constructed 
        (sewers, roads) and an increase in annual maintenance fees (including 
        emergency services, schools, etc.). The increased income must also be 
        weighed against contributions to the local economy made by the old farmland 
        which required far less infrastructure. A further detrimental effect is 
        that new construction causes the value of nearby property to drop --most 
        people would prefer to move into the new suburbs rather than those which 
        are a few years old -- resulting in a corresponding drop in city revenue 
        from property taxes.</p>
      <p>With new income not matching new expenses, cities have been forced to 
        take on bond debt to make up the shortfall, with the cost of this due 
        to be paid by increased taxes and fees on future residents and developers. 
        With expenditure continually increasing and income not keeping pace, the 
        reinforcing loop of bonds and repayment is set to stay unless the contributing 
        factors in the system are changed.</p>
      <p>One solution would be to enforce land use restrictions making developers 
        rebuild on more central, previously developed, land. If &quot;Development 
        on undeveloped land&quot; in the diagram were replaced with &quot;Redevelopment&quot; 
        we could remove the downward force on &quot;Amount of farmland&quot; (leaving 
        its tax contribution intact), and the negative effect on neighbouring 
        property values would be reduced. Additionally, we could remove the need 
        for new infrastructure, thus halting the increase in expenditure.</p>
      <p>An alternative would be to force developers to pay the infrastructure 
        costs themselves, again relieving pressure on city expenditure. This move 
        is unlikely to be popular with developers, smart growth enthusiasts or 
        the home buyers who would see themselves footing the bill with increased 
        house prices.</p>

      <p><b>The relationship between hurricane frequency and atmospheric temperature</b> 
        (click image for larger version)<br>
        <a href="examples4_big.gif" title="Click for larger version"><img src="examples4.gif" width="361" height="271" border="0" alt="The relationship between hurricane frequency and atmospheric temperature"></a></p>
      <p>There are two factors relating the frequency of hurricanes and the temperature 
        of the Earth's atmosphere, creating a systems of positive feedback which 
        causes both to rise. Computer modelling implies that as the planet warms 
        up the frequency and intensity of hurricanes will both increase. Global 
        temperature already seems to be rising due to the amount of carbon dioxide 
        human activity is releasing into the air, but it appears that hurricanes 
        themselves can add to the problem: such a storm can be so powerful that 
        carbon dioxide is pulled from the sea's surface and released into the 
        atmosphere. At the moment this contribution is only 1/12 the size of the 
        carbon dioxide emissions released by human activity, but this could rise, 
        depending on the strength of the positive feedback loop. Cutting our own 
        contributions would of course slow the process dramatically.</p>
