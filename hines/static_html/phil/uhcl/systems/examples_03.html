      <p><b>The effect on a deer population of its predators being hunted</b>

        <a href="examples5_big.gif" title="Click for larger version"><img src="examples5.gif" width="361" height="271" border="0" alt="The effect on a deer population of its predators being hunted"></a></p>
      <p>As settlers spread into the West, they killed vast numbers of animals, 
        from grizzlies to mice, in an effort to make the wild more suitable for 
        habitation. Hunting on this scale had a variety of effects on the rest 
        of the ecosystem, and one of the best examples is that of hunting in the 
        national game preserve of Arizona's Kaibab Plateau.</p>
      <p>As the number of humans in the area increased, the need (and the ability) 
        to kill the predatory animals increased. In just over ten years 674 cougars, 
        3,000 coyotes and 120 bobcats were killed. As the number of predators 
        available to kill the areas deer population decreased, so the number of 
        deer increased. With almost all predators being wiped out, the deer population 
        shot from around 3,000 in 1906 to over 100,000 in 1924. This increase 
        meant the rate at which the local fauna was consumed similarly shot up, 
        past its ability to regenerate itself. With the deer eating vegetation 
        faster than it could grow, soon there was almost no food left, with the 
        result that most of the deer swiftly died, leaving an expanse of largely 
        bare (but predator-free) land.</p>

      <p>Most people are familiar with the concept of global warming caused by 
        the increasing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. 
        This warming could, however, see temperatures in Europe drop due to the 
        disruption of an otherwise stable system.</p>
      <p>In the Atlantic Ocean there is a convection system known as the conveyor 
        belt, illustrating its movements: warm water from the south moves northwards 
        (the North Atlantic Drift) releasing its heat into the atmosphere, before 
        sinking to 2-3km below the surface and travelling south (North Atlantic 
        Deep Water). This rolling system is fuelled by the salinity and temperature 
        of the waters which determine their density. The northern waters have 
        lost much of their heat, have higher salinity and are thus more dense, 
        causing them to sink and keep the conveyor rolling. Freshwater (rain, 
        rivers, melting ice and snow) join the waters in the northern latitudes 
        and threaten to reduce the salinity, and hence density, of the sea. However, 
        the freshwater is continually flushed away to the south and the system 
        keeps rolling.</p>
      <p>One of the effects of global warming is to increase the amount of rainfall 
        and melting ice which will increase the flow of freshwater into the sea. 
        This is reducing the salinity of the sea water flowing south and could 
        cause the conveyor belt to slow. With less warm water reaching the North 
        Atlantic on the conveyor, temperatures in North Western Europe (currently 
        higher than many in similar latitudes) could drop. Any significant drop 
        in temperature could cause greater amounts of sea ice to form and this 
        would reflect more sunlight from the surface, reducing air temperatures 
        further.</p>
      <p>CO2 use may reach a peak and then slow in the next century, causing temperatures 
        to gradually (over centuries) fall back. The circulation in the Atlantic 
        could either slow and recover or stop entirely. Models have shown that 
        either is possible, depending on whether the freshwater disruption reaches 
        a certain threshold which would cause a collapse of the system.</p>
