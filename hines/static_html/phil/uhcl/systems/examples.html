      <p><b>The Watt steam governor</b> (click image for larger version)<br>

      <p>The purpose of this device is to regulate the speed of a steam-powered 
        engine. The governor is a pair of metal balls, each affixed to the top 
        of a vertical rod by a hinged arm. As the steam engine turns this rod, 
        centrifugal force causes the balls to rise towards a horizontal position. 
        The hinged arms are connected to the steam valve that feeds the engine, 
        and as they approach the horizontal position the steam is shut off. This 
        causes the engine to slow, and as it does so gravity plays its part in 
        counteracting the centrifugal force on the arms, with the result that 
        they drop. With the arms dropping, the engine is free to increase its 
        speed again. This mechanism thus causes the speed of the engine to oscillate 
        between two points.</p>

      <p><b>Restrictions on traffic growth</b> (click image for larger version)<br>

      <p>The increase in the amount of traffic on our roads, along with the increase 
        in the number of roads themselves, is a classic positive feedback loop. 
        As the amount of congestion worsens, more roads are built to accommodate 
        the growing number of cars. These new roads swiftly fill up with cars 
        however, encouraging the construction of more. While this has been continuing 
        for decades, it is only now that we're beginning to see balancing loop 
        which may have a dampening effect on traffic and road growth.</p>
      <p>It was inevitable that eventually something would cause growth to slow 
        before the ultimate limit was reached: no land remaining for road construction. 
        The severity of congestion could have caused people to rethink the benefits, 
        but this wasn't deterrent enough, and what seemed like an easy solution 
        (more roads) was more attractive. It seems that increasing air pollution 
        may be the factor which brings about balancing feedback.</p>
      <p>The decreasing quality of air pollution is causing governments, local 
        and national, to begin measures curbing certain kinds of growth. The Environmental 
        Protection Agency has put restrictions on federal money for highway construction 
        in areas near Atlanta due to the pollution. This has spurred businesses 
        in the area to look at what they can do to improve matters, such as consolidating 
        distributed offices into centralised facilities. In addition, the Georgia 
        Regional Transportation Authority (Greta) has the power to construct (or 
        not) roads and public transport, and only intends to approve new development 
        in densely populated areas (cutting down on travel distances) or near 
        mass transit. Whether Greta achieves this or not, it is one of many indicators 
        that governments are slowly taking action to restrict traffic growth before 
        businesses and consumers would have done so. There are of course reactions 
        against this control, such as the desire of landowners to sell their land 
        to developers, but this movement may at least slow the rate of traffic 
        growth.</p>
