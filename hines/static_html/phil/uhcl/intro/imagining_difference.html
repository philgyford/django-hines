        This is the most fun bit of future studies and (unlike this paper) is 
        best done with a group of people. This method involves choosing three 
        emerging trends, looking at the impacts they will have and describing 
        the world you've created. Top stuff.]</font></p>
      <p>[ <b>Scenario 1</b> | <a href="imagining_difference_02.html">Scenario 
        2</a> ]</p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p>This scenario was created using the Hawaii Research Center method of 
        scenario building, and is set in the year 2025. The following three trends 
        were used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Robots for simple tasks become widespread 
        <li>Continued and increased wealth divide 
        <li>Carbon fuels become increasingly expensive
      </ul>
      <p><b>Scenario Description</b></p>
      <p>While worries about the depletion of natural resources have been heard 
        for decades, resources are still available. However, new sources proved 
        expensive and dangerous to access and this resulted in steadily rising 
        costs leading to price increases for fuel and electricity. In a society 
        where the separation between rich and poor has widened, many people cannot 
        afford the energy once taken for granted. Those in the lower end of society 
        who can still afford to run combustion-engined cars (and they certainly 
        can¹t afford new 'green' cars) must restrict their travel as much as possible. 
        Conserving power has become ingrained among these people and energy-hungry 
        appliances are used sparingly or not at all.</p>
      <p>As robots became increasingly prevalent in society many of the poor lost 
        their low-end jobs. Many cleaning tasks, both in- and outdoor, were given 
        over to automated machines which could happily sweep, mop and polish day 
        and night. As people became more accustomed to these robotic helpers many 
        service jobs were automated with the help of voice recognition. Large 
        stores and fast food outlets, for example, managed to drastically cut 
        the number of humans required.</p>
      <p>Conversely, for the wealthy life has by and large become more comfortable. 
        While energy costs have been a problem many can afford the higher prices 
        and even switch to alternative premium suppliers (or re-branded branches 
        of existing utility companies) which guarantee none of the occasional 
        outages which plague the traditional sources. Alternatively, many plan 
        ahead for a situation only getting worse by installing solar panels on 
        their houses and improving the energy efficiency of their homes. They 
        can also afford to buy newer, more energy efficient vehicles. Rates of 
        international travel have slowed however as flights become prohibitively 
        expensive to all but the most wealthy.</p>
      <p>The very robotic helpers which have caused so many job losses have made 
        life much more comfortable for society's well-off. They can afford a number 
        of helpers and electronic appliances which give them increased leisure 
        time. These servants can maintain the house and garden, look after and 
        educate young children, and provide security. Sending children to private 
        schools is perfectly common, and indicative of the separation between 
        the two strata of society. They are physically separated much of the time, 
        particularly with many poor people unable to afford to travel far from 
        their communities, and frequently forbidden from entering the guarded 
        world of the wealthy. The well-off live in a society where menial tasks 
        are undertaken by machines, and whose homes and communities are protected 
        by robots. The poor see little reason for hope. Uprisings and grass-roots 
        action are increasingly common with a number of people able to 'hack' 
        robots to turn them into destructive forces.</p>
      <p>Government is under pressure from both ends of the divide. The poor understandably 
        desire jobs and are requiring a larger and larger welfare outlay. The 
        wealthy however see themselves paying the bulk of the taxes and want more 
        of a return on their money, not to mention increased law and order measures 
        to combat the insurrections from below.</p>

            <li>Tendency for robot street cleaners etc. not to be sent to poor 
              areas for fear of theft/vandalism.
