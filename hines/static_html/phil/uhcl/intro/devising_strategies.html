      <p><font color="#999999">[Comment: My least favourite of the Introduction 
        papers. This is the final part of a process which involved, the class 
        coming up with their preferred futures, identifying three necessary outcomes 
        for those futures, and plotting a timeline of events which must occur 
        to make those outcomes happen. We then had to choose two of those events 
        and detail them. This passed, but I think it's crap.]</font></p>
      <p><b>Outcome in 2030:</b> Implanted chip which monitors vital health signs 
        and communicates with doctors, emergency services, etc.<br>
      <b>Event in 2020:</b> Health chip trials.</p>
      <p>Such a radically new device will require extensive testing before being 
        made available to the public through either the NHS or private healthcare. 
        Government health bodies should be kept updated on progress of the testing 
        so that they are ready to consider implementing changes as soon as is 
        feasible.</p>
      <p>Media attention is bound to be heavy, but care should be taken not to 
        raise hopes and generate hype (or scare stories) before trials are complete. 
        Assessment of progress should begin early in the process with continual 
        iterative reporting. In reporting the results of the testing both the 
        health benefits and cost benefits should be made clear, along with an 
        ethical justification for continuing trials.</p>
      <p>In order for this active implantable medical device to become available 
        on the market it must be issued with a CE mark indicating it meets European 
        standards. This is issued by the UK Competent Authority (ie, the Secretary 
        of State for Health acting through the Medical Devices Agency) and the 
        approval of the local Research Ethics Committee must first be found.</p>
      <p><b>Outcome in 2030:</b> 100% reduction of industrial effluent.<br>
      <b>Event in 2000:</b> Putting pressure on government.</p>
      <p>Pressure must be exerted on government to highlight the dangers of industrial 
        waste. Using <a href="http://www.stand.org.uk/">Stand.org.uk</a> as a 
        model, a large number of people could be mobilised with comparatively 
        little effort. Each person taking part &quot;adopts&quot; their local 
        MP by registering at the website and inputting their postcode. When an 
        event occurs about which MPs must be pressured, one person sends a letter 
        outlining the complaint. Everyone else who has adopted that MP receives 
        an email asking them to send a postcard to their MP supporting this letter. 
        This method is much more effective than bombarding MPs with letter campaigns 
        or petitions (which have a tendency to be ignored) and is liable to be 
        more noticeable and respected. If, at some point in the future, MPs were 
        to adopt email to a greater extent this process could be transferred to 
        email making it easier for campaigners. </p>
      <p>This process could be used to highlight events such as chemical spills, 
        excessive waste output, etc. Given that many of these events are local 
        in nature, the network should be extended to cover county and district 
        councils, enabling a more focussed effort at generating discussion. The 
        largest events should result in protest directed at national representatives, 
        smaller events at local councils. Given the increasing powers of European 
        government, there is scope for joining with campaigners in other countries 
        and targetting Euro MPs.</p>
      <p>Campaigns should also be directed at media organisations, encouraging 
        them to think that this is a newsworthy topic which they should cover. 
        Assisting them to package stories as human interest, rather than, say, 
        industrial spillage could improve prominence. The ability for campaigning 
        groups to create, edit and distribute their own coverage to the media 
        (as the J18 organisers did) can only help achieve a high profile among 
        the public.</p>
