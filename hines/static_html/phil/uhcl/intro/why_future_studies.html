      <p><font color="#999999">[Comment: This paper answers a number of set questions 
        which is why it reads a little strangely. Plus I was being a bit sarcastic 
        at times.]</font></p>
      <p>In coming to write this paper, and thinking about plausible futures for 
        the world, I surprised myself in realizing I have no image of the future 
        sitting ready-formed in my mind. While I like to think I keep up with 
        a broad range of news, trying to map out the most likely future for the 
        world reveals to me how sketchy and UK/USA-centric my view is. </p>
      <p>I see politics in the western world continuing along its increasingly 
        muddled and vaguely centrist path. While the apathetic electorate will 
        be offered some socially responsible policies, governments will become 
        increasingly authoritarian, in an effort to combat growing numbers of 
        extremist and grass-roots groups (for example, the worldwide anti-capitalist 
        demonstrations in June 1999 or, further afield, groups of Indian farmers 
        protesting against Monsanto's genetically modified crops). Technology 
        will enable such organizations to recruit and coordinate more easily than 
        ever before. Worldwide, the rocketing populations and increasing standards 
        of living in countries like China and India will prove to be a huge burden 
        on the world's resources. Governments will begin to implement more environmentally 
        friendly policies, too late to prevent all disasters. Technology will 
        provide opportunities to help us meet the pressures of this world, but 
        some, such as genetic modification, will meet with concerted opposition. 
        There will be a growing number of small 'cold wars' around the globe as 
        old rivals increase both offensive and defensive capabilities, watched 
        over by international agencies such as NATO, the World Bank, etc.</p>
      <p>There aren't many features I share with a stereotypical Miss World contestant, 
        but I believe the most pleasant future for the planet would be one of 
        peace and happiness. No one would have to work unless they wanted to (all 
        the dull and dangerous jobs being undertaken by robots that never malfunction) 
        and no one would want for anything. There would be jam for tea every day.</p>
      <p>When it comes to my most feared but plausible future, it would be like 
        any random dystopian sci-fi world but without the fun bits. Governments 
        find themselves with almost no real power, with larger and larger corporations 
        holding the balance of power. No progress is made on worldwide agreements 
        of ecological issues, with the result that pollution and famine shoot 
        out of control. The split between rich and poor widens at an increasing 
        rate, leaving a small percentage of phenomenally wealthy individuals isolated 
        from the increasingly harsh world in which more and more people are suffering.</p>
      <p>Asking if futures studies is useful is like asking if it's useful to 
        open your eyes while walking. You could probably reach your destination 
        with your eyes closed, but you're going to hit a lot of unexpected obstacles 
        along the way. Working out what might be ahead allows us to prepare for 
        different eventualities. A company could muddle along until it hits a 
        crisis but it would be better to know what crises could potentially manifest 
        themselves in advance, so preparations can be made.</p>
      <p>The only way I can see futures studies being dangerous is if people take 
        its scenarios as definite predictions. We can never be sure what the future 
        will bring, so concentrating all resources on meeting one particular outcome 
        could prove disastrous.</p>
      <p>Worldwide I see the most critical issue we can study is working out how 
        to cope with the increasing demands of a booming population and rising 
        standards of living.</p>
      <p>The most useful data we can collect depends entirely on which future 
        possibilities we are trying to understand. The most interesting thing 
        about the future is that anything could happen.</p>
