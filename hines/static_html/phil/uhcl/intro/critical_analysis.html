      <p><font color="#999999">[Comment: The task was to critique a piece of futures 
        research so I grabbed an article from the World Future Society's magazine, 
        which is reliably full of articles not worth reading. So you're missing 
        nothing in being unable to read it here. Fish. Barrel.]</font></p>
      <p>In 'The Pied Piper Goes Electronic,' an article taken from the February 
        1999 issue of <i>The Futurist</i>, Deborah C. Sawyer sketches a future 
        in which we are led astray by an Internet swamped with unreliable information 
        and an inability to determine what is true. Much of this is based on her 
        images of Internet use as it stands now, with very little evidence other 
        than her own anecdotes. I will take her main points in turn and examine 
        them using Dr. Peter Bishop's method of critical analysis.</p>
      <p>Sawyer's first "catalyst of chaos" is <b>increased access to information</b>, 
        and the complaint that "no one wants to entertain the suggestions that 
        information may be private." As evidence goes, this is less than solid 
        and without an expansion of this I can merely counter that I've yet to 
        hear of anyone suggesting all information should be free. </p>
      <p>Coupled with the first point is a <b>decrease in sharing</b>, stating 
        that people share less information than they used to. This idea is backed 
        up with the claim that fewer people take part in surveys than they used 
        to, assuming the reason for this is a conscious choice by possible respondents 
        to avoid sharing information. Conversely, I would say that people are 
        avoiding surveys for the more immediate desire not to spend their time 
        on a survey for which they see no immediate benefit. </p>
      <p>Third and fourth on Sawyer's list are two more points about information, 
        coupled as an <b>increase in quantity</b> and <b>decrease in quality</b> 
        of information. Her concern here is that information on the Internet is 
        mostly useless due to its potential inaccuracy. This is because there 
        is "little copy editing or fact checking" and "anything and everything 
        gets circulated." Here she makes the mistake of comparing the Internet 
        to the kind of magazines and newspapers you might immediately associate 
        with copy editing and fact checking. Leaving aside the question of whether 
        you can completely trust everything you read in these edited and checked 
        periodicals, the correct Internet comparison is with all forms of print; 
        not just professional journals but, for example, pamphlets you might be 
        handed in the street, political materials, or self-published fanzines. 
        Sawyer is right in claiming there is an awful lot of disinformation on 
        the Internet, but she should not avoid the fact there may be an equivalent 
        proportion out in the "real world" of print. Just as we learn to judge 
        what to trust in the real world, so we must learn to judge what we read 
        online.</p>
      <p>Her fifth claim is that the Internet, despite its ease of communication, 
        causes an <b>increase in barriers</b> between people, relying for her 
        evidence on the claim that companies use the Internet to avoid giving 
        people information person to person. This is demonstrated, she says, by 
        the fact that if you "phone up an association or a government department 
        Š you are more than likely to be told to consult the Web site." Agreed, 
        this is not the most friendly response, but it makes the assumption that 
        the organization concerned would have shared the information with one 
        before they constructed a Web site. Perhaps some companies do fob callers 
        off with a suggestion of looking online, but would these same companies 
        really have offered access to any information you could wish for had you 
        called five years ago?</p>
      <p>Next, Sawyer claims that communication via the Internet is resulting 
        in a <b>decrease in courtesy</b>, just as it has also "become acceptable 
        to not return phone calls or respond to messages." Leaving aside the question 
        of whether failing to return calls is acceptable, what of her belief that 
        the occurrence of rude behaviour is increasing with the rise of email? 
        Firstly, she is assuming that people are perfectly polite to each other 
        while communicating using other media. Secondly, the rise of rude behaviour 
        is only to be expected in a medium whose use is growing exponentially; 
        I expect her article detailing the parallel increase in the occurrence 
        of polite behaviour any month now.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the least supported of her ill-supported arguments is the <b>increase 
        in dishonesty</b>, and that "the Information Age is rife with cheating 
        and plagiarism." Without even anecdotal evidence to support this point 
        (save the fact that some people download essays from the Internet, just 
        as people have copied essays by hand since time immemorial), it's hard 
        to undermine. I've little doubt that there are dishonest deeds occurring 
        right now on the Internet, but then I don't think Sawyer herself would 
        deny the presence of cheating and plagiarism in the real world.</p>
      <p>Finally, she brings all her points together in the eighth and final "catalyst 
        of chaos," the <b>decrease in skills</b>, summed up by "the ability to 
        access information Š does not create an ability to evaluate it." Sawyer 
        expands on this point further than the previous seven, beginning with 
        the claim that young people have been brought up without solid skills 
        in reading and mathematics, but believing anything they see on the computer. 
        The other side of the coin is that these same children have been brought 
        up in an age surrounded by computers and ever-expanding media and have 
        far more experience of interacting with this multitude of influences than 
        previous generations.</p>
      <p>All this has been pointing the way towards Sawyer's view of the future 
        dangers of the Internet, which she illustrates with her scenario of a 
        foreign power conquering the United States by "posting information on 
        the Internet and bamboozling the people." As she gives no suggestion as 
        to what sort of time frame she pictures this danger happening in, we must 
        assume it's an imminent problem. While it would be entirely possible for 
        foreign hackers to change information on some US Web sites, the chances 
        of them managing convincingly to alter the vast multitude of information 
        sources Sawyer has spent the rest of the article worrying about seem slim. 
        She illustrates this frightening future scenario with an event from the 
        past, the 1938 radio broadcast of <i>War of the Worlds</i>, which many 
        listeners assumed was an authentic news broadcast. However, this is not 
        a helpful comparison for the world today (or the future) as anyone concerned 
        about a Web story of alien invasion would only have to look at other Web 
        sites, switch on CNN or in fact listen to the radio to confirm its veracity.</p>
      <p>Her final example of the Internet's dangers is that of the urban myth, 
        a false but just about believable tale spreading like wildfire via (in 
        this case) email. Although the Internet is only accelerating an existing 
        phenomenon, this could indeed be a concern and does illustrate the need 
        for people to be able to tell fact from fiction, a task that is all the 
        more difficult when the ambiguous text arrives in an email from one's 
        friend. However, the medium is yet young in mass media terms, and we can 
        hope that people are learning to judge the authenticity of material on 
        the Internet. Everyone is burned once by virus warnings, cookie recipies 
        and requests for business cards from a boy with cancer, but these are 
        all part of the learning experience.</p>
