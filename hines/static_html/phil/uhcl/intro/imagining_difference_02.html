        scenario. Perhaps the communications technology trend is too specific 
        compared to the other, more general and global, trends. Within it I seem 
        to have ended up with conflicting trends of some people wanting their 
        own lands, and others not feeling attached to geography at all. Maybe

      <p>[ <a href="imagining_difference.html">Scenario 1</a> | <b>Scenario 2</b> 
        ] </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p>This scenario was created using the Hawaii Research Center method of 
        scenario building, and is set in the year 2025. The following three trends 
        were used: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increasingly miniaturised and personalised communication devices</li>
        <li>Nations fragmenting into smaller regional areas/cultures</li>
        <li>Global temperatures rise </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Scenario Description</b></p>
      <p>Despite the claims of many that global warming would not be a major problem, 
        events seem to have proved them wrong. Industrialised nations were largely 
        unwilling to enforce anything but the weakest measures on pollution, and 
        were definitely unwilling to subsidise environment-friendly development 
        of poorer countries. Population and economic growth has proved disastrous 
        for the environment with climatic effects being felt increasingly over 
        recent years. While unusual weather patterns at the end of the twentieth 
        century could have statistically been a mere blip, it now seems they were 
        a precursor of more unstable weather preceding what seems to be a rise 
        in global temperature. The lowest lands are having increasing troubles 
        with flooding, and many ecologically sensitive wetlands have been wiped 
        out. Fresh water aquifers, already severely depleted in developing countries, 
        have become infiltrated by salt water, rendering them useless. Many crops 
        have failed in warmer countries, with starvation the all-too frequent 
        result, along with lack of income due to the inability to export.</p>
      <p>The feeling that governments aren't doing enough to solve the situation 
        (whether there is more they can do or not is irrelevant) has increased 
        the determination of many groups to separate themselves from the nation 
        and go their own way. Many areas around the world are demanding independence 
        (particularly if they have land or water that's so far surviving the climate 
        change), and dispersed ethnic groups demanding their own land. Some of 
        this is peaceful, gradual and democratic with regional pride and culture 
        a positive force. Other factions are taking matters further with the number 
        of small conflicts around the world increasing. Demonstrations are often 
        carried over into other countries, in the hope that more powerful nations 
        and/or international organisations will notice the plight of the self-proclaimed 
        'homeless' groups. These actions have become more widespread and more 
        elaborate, aided and synchronised by modern communications technology.</p>
      <p>This same technology has also lead to another, generally less destructive, 
        form of fragmentation. People can now be in constant communication with 
        anyone else, any other group of people, anywhere in the world. In the 
        developed world it's fairly normal for the younger generation to be constantly 
        communicating with friends whose geographical location is irrelevant, 
        or watching events happening elsewhere. This ease of communication with 
        their self-created groups has led younger people to feel less attached 
        to their national culture and more part of dispersed global culture. Increasing 
        numbers travel from place to place, and from job to job.</p>
      <p>The developed world hasn't yet been as badly hit as the rest of the world 
        by global warming and only in recent years have they begun to take concerted 
        effort to curb pollution. Their minds have perhaps been focused by increasing 
        grass-roots activities by both western activist groups and representatives 
        of the developing nations who are suffering most from global warming. 
        They have proved harder and harder to stop, organising and co-ordinating 
        their dispersed activities with the latest communications equipment.</p>
