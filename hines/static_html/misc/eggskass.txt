basically, you roast some red peppers in the oven and then peel them,
make hollandaise sauce, toast the muffins, poach the eggs, butter the
muffins, put slices of roasted pepper and feta on the buttered
muffins, top each muffin with a poached egg, and smother in
hollandaise sauce.

hollandaise sauce is much harder to explain than to actually make.  I
recommend The Joy of Cooking for some easy to follow recipes.

roasting peppers: wash & dry peppers then rub them with olive oil and
place in hot oven (gas mark 6-8) for, oh, 20 minutes or until skin
starts to get brown blisters.  remove and put in covered bowl to
cool...this will make them easier to peel.

poaching eggs: drop in simmering water with a dash of vinegar for
about 5 minutes or until whites look just firm enough...careful not to
overcook as the yolks are meant to be runny.
