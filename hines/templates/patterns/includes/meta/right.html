<article class="bodytext">

  <aside class="meta meta--right">
    <ul class="meta__inner">
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Another longer <a href="#">thing</a> here
    </li>
    <li>
      And one more
    </li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <p>The meta box can be aligned right and it will take up a maximum of 50% of the horizontal width, at wide browser widths. <strong>Note:</strong> The container must have clearfix applied or else things below might collapse upwards, which wouldn't be much fun. I'll just write another fairly long sentence so we can see this text wrapping around the box in a pleasing fashion.</p>
