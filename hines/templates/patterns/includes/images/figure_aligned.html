<p>This figure has the <code>.figure-right</code> class. At narrow widths it will take up the full width of its container, and the image within will be a maximum of 100% width, or its natural size, if smaller. At wider widths it will float right, be a maximum of 50% of the container’s width, and text will wrap around it. <em>This is just some extra text to fill up the space and stop the two images crashing into each other, something you have to be careful of if putting images not very far apart. It can take a lot of text if you want it to fully wrap around the figure like this.</em></p>
