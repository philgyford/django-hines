<p id="anchors-p1">
  <a class="section-anchor" href="#anchors-p1">ยง</a> &nbsp;
  Section anchor markers can be added to elements like this.

<p id="anchors-p2">
  <a class="section-anchor" href="#anchors-p2" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link to this section">ยง</a> &nbsp;
  In reality a bit more markup is good, the `style` is in case it works in things like RSS readers where our CSS won't be present.
