<div class="demo-text-style-default">
  <h3>Default</h3>
  <p>The default text style is this, used for large chunks of text and, broadly, “content”. However, headings are <em>not</em> in this style, by default. </p>

  <p>Here’s another paragraph so we can see the spacing and some more features. <a href="#">Here is a link, for example</a>, and <small>here is some small text</small> (which uses <code>&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;</code> tags). We should look at superscript<sup>12</sup> and subscript<sub>12</sub> numbers, to see how they affect <code>line-height</code>. Here's an abbreviation: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. <span class="u-note">[And this is a note.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="demo-text-style-bodytext bodytext">
  <h3>Bodytext</h3>
  <p>The "bodytext" class is used for things like blog posts, and other main content, and makes the text larger, which is more suitable when reading a lot of stuff, particularly with a wider column. Note that it also changes the style of headings to be serif – see examples <a href="#bodytext">below</a>.</p>

<div class="demo-text-style-nav">
  <h3>Nav</h3>
  <p>The “nav” text style is used for shorter, more navigational elements, “meta” information about things, and headings. You wouldn’t use it for a paragraph like this. It is sans-serif, bold, always uppercase, and always the same size (except when used for headings).</p>
</div>

<div class="demo-text-style-alt">
  <h3>Alt</h3>
  <p>The “alt” text style is the same font and weight as the “nav” style but is smaller and mixed-case. It’s used for form help text, sidebar items that are longer than a couple of words, image captions, etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="demo-text-style-tiny">
  <h3>Tiny</h3>
  <p>The “tiny” text style is like the “alt” style but not bold, and smaller. The line-height is 1.5 times a standard “vertical space”, unlike “alt”s 2 times.</p>
</div>
